- en: Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model’s performance gain while annotating
    the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires
    a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the
    model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to
    the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information
    abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL
    has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed.
    Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This
    is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires
    relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the
    value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most
    of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets.
    However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets
    consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels
    of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images,
    etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due.

    cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of
    DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged.
    Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive
    survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap.
    We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a
    comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize
    the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss
    the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development
    directions.

- en: 'Both deep learning (DL) and active learning (AL) are a subfield of machine
    learning. DL is also called representation learning (Deng, [2014](#bib.bib51)).
    It originates from the study of artificial neural networks and realizes the automatic
    extraction of data features. DL has strong learning capabilities due to its complex
    structure, but this also means that DL requires a large number of labeled samples
    to complete the corresponding training. With the release of a large number of
    large-scale data sets with annotations and the continuous improvement of computer
    computing power, DL-related research has ushered in large development opportunities.
    Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, DL has an absolute advantage
    in performance in most application areas. AL focuses on the study of data sets,
    and it is also known as query learning (Settles, [2009](#bib.bib194)). AL assumes
    that different samples in the same data set have different values for the update
    of the current model, and tries to select the samples with the highest value to
    construct the training set. Then, the corresponding learning task is completed
    with the smallest annotation cost. Both DL and AL have important applications
    in the machine learning community. Due to their excellent characteristics, they
    have attracted widespread research interest in recent years. More specifically,
    DL has achieved unprecedented breakthroughs in various challenging tasks; however,
    this is largely due to the publication of massive labeled datasets (Bengio et al.,
    [2006](#bib.bib22); Krizhevsky et al., [2012](#bib.bib121)). Therefore, DL is
    limited by the high cost of sample labeling in some professional fields that require
    rich knowledge. In comparison, an effective AL algorithm can theoretically achieve
    exponential acceleration in labeling efficiency (Balcan et al., [2009](#bib.bib18)).
    This large potential saving in labeling costs is a fascinating development. However,
    the classic AL algorithm also finds it difficult to handle high-dimensional data
    (Tong, [2001](#bib.bib222)). Therefore, the combination of DL and AL, referred
    to as DeepAL, is expected to achieve superior results. DeepAL has been widely
    utilized in various fields, including image recognition (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57);
    Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73); Gudovskiy et al., [2020](#bib.bib83); Huang et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib99)), text classification (Zhang et al., [2017b](#bib.bib252);
    Schröder and Niekler, [2020](#bib.bib191)), visual question answering (Lin and
    Parikh, [2017](#bib.bib135)) and object detection (Qu et al., [2020](#bib.bib171);
    Aghdam et al., [2019](#bib.bib5); Feng et al., [2019](#bib.bib64)), etc. Although
    a rich variety of related work has been published, DeepAL still lacks a unified
    classification framework. To fill this gap, in this article, we will provide a
    comprehensive overview of the existing DeepAL related work ¹¹1We search about
    270 related papers on [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) using ”deep active learning”
    as the keyword. We review the relevance of these papers to DeepAL one by one,
    eliminate irrelevant (just containing a few keywords) or information missing papers,
    and manually add some papers that do not contain these keywords but use DeepAL-related
    methods or relate to our current discussion. Finally, the survey references are
    constructed. The latest paper is updated to November 2020\. The references include
    103 conference papers, 153 journal papers, 3 books (Sanderson, [2008](#bib.bib184);
    Tong, [2001](#bib.bib222); Farahani and Hekmatfar, [2009](#bib.bib63)), 1 research
    report (Settles, [2009](#bib.bib194)), and 1 dissertation (Zhu et al., [2005](#bib.bib261)).
    There are 28 unpublished papers., along with a formal classification method. The
    contributions of this survey are summarized as follows:'

    human brain. The McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) model proposed in 1943 by (Fitch, [1944](#bib.bib66))
    is regarded as the beginning of modern DL. Subsequently, in 1986, (Rumelhart et al.,
    [1986b](#bib.bib181)) introduced backpropagation into the optimization of neural
    networks, which laid the foundation for the subsequent rapid development of DL.
    In the same year, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Jordan, [1986](#bib.bib106))
    were first proposed. In 1998, the LeNet (LeCun et al., [1998](#bib.bib129)) network
    made its first appearance, representing one of the earliest uses of deep neural
    networks (DNN). However, these pioneering early works were limited by the computing
    resources available at the time and did not receive as much attention and investigation
    as they should have (Lecun et al., [2015](#bib.bib127)). In 2006, Deep Belief
    Networks (DBNs) (Hinton et al., [2006](#bib.bib92)) were proposed and used to
    explore a deeper range of networks, which prompted the name of neural networks
    as DL. AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., [2012](#bib.bib121)) is considered the first
    CNN deep learning model, which greatly improves the image classification results
    on large-scale data sets (such as ImageNet). In the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual
    Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)-2012 competition (Deng et al., [2012](#bib.bib50)),
    the AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., [2012](#bib.bib121)) won the championship in the
    top-5 test error rate by nearly 10% ahead of the second place. AlexNet uses the
    ReLUs (Rectified Linear Units) (Nair and Hinton, [2010](#bib.bib151)) activation
    function to effectively suppress the gradient disappearance problem, while the
    use of multiple GPUs greatly improves the training speed of the model. Subsequently,
    DL began to win championships in various competitions and demonstrated very competitive
    results in many fields, such as visual data processing, natural language processing,
    speech processing, and many other well-known applications (Yan et al., [2017](#bib.bib241),
    [2015](#bib.bib242)). From the perspective of automation, the emergence of DL
    has transformed the manual design of features (Dalal and Triggs, [2005](#bib.bib43);
    Lowe, [1999](#bib.bib140)) in machine learning to facilitate automatic extraction
    (Simonyan and Zisserman, [2015](#bib.bib204); He et al., [2016](#bib.bib88)).
    It is precisely because of this powerful automatic feature extraction capability
    that DL has demonstrated such unprecedented advantages in many fields. After decades
    of development, the research work related to DL is very rich. In Fig.[1a](#S1.F1.sf1
    "In Figure 1 ‣ 1.1\. Deep Learning ‣ 1\. Introduction ‣ A Survey of Deep Active
    Learning"), we present a standard deep learning model example: convolutional neural
    network (CNN) (Rumelhart et al., [1986a](#bib.bib180); LeCun et al., [1989](#bib.bib128)).
    Based on this approach, similar CNNs are applied to various image processing tasks.
    In addition, RNNs and GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) (Salvaris et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib183)) are also widely utilized. Beginning in 2017, DL gradually
    shifted from the initial feature extraction automation to the automation of model
    architecture design (Zoph and Le, [2017](#bib.bib263); Ren et al., [2020](#bib.bib175);
    Baker et al., [2017](#bib.bib17)); however, this still has a long way to go.'

    (Bengio et al., [2006](#bib.bib22); Krizhevsky et al., [2012](#bib.bib121)), in
    recent years, DL has made breakthroughs in various fields including machine translation
    (Aharoni et al., [2019](#bib.bib6); Tan et al., [2019a](#bib.bib218); Wang et al.,
    [2019b](#bib.bib232); Bau et al., [2019](#bib.bib19)), speech recognition (Park
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib160); Nassif et al., [2019](#bib.bib153); Qin et al., [2019](#bib.bib170);
    Schneider et al., [2019](#bib.bib190)), and image classification (He et al., [2019b](#bib.bib90);
    Mateen et al., [2019](#bib.bib145); Paoletti et al., [2019](#bib.bib159); Yalniz
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib240)). However, this comes at the cost of a large number
    of manually labeled datasets, and DL has a strong greedy attribute to the data.
    While, in the real world, obtaining a large number of unlabeled datasets is relatively
    simple, the manual labeling of datasets comes at a high cost; this is particularly
    true for those fields where labeling requires a high degree of professional knowledge
    (Hoi et al., [2006](#bib.bib95); Smith et al., [2018](#bib.bib208)). For example,
    the labeling and description of lung lesion images of COVID-19 patients requires
    experienced clinicians to complete, and it is clearly impractical to demand that
    such professionals complete a large amount of medical image labeling. Similar
    fields also include speech recognition (Zhu et al., [2005](#bib.bib261); Abdel-Wahab
    and Busso, [2019](#bib.bib2)), medical imaging (Hoi et al., [2006](#bib.bib95);
    Nam et al., [2019](#bib.bib152); Lee and Paeng, [2018](#bib.bib130); Yang et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib244)), recommender systems (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, [2005](#bib.bib3);
    Cheng et al., [2019](#bib.bib38)), information extraction (Bhattacharjee et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib23)), satellite remote sensing (Liu et al., [2017](#bib.bib136))
    and robotics (Calinon et al., [2007](#bib.bib33); Andersson et al., [2017](#bib.bib9);
    Takahashi et al., [2017](#bib.bib217); Zhou and Schoellig, [2019](#bib.bib259);
    Burka and Kuchenbecker, [2017](#bib.bib32)), machine translation (Bloodgood and
    Callison-Burch, [2014](#bib.bib26); Platanios et al., [2019](#bib.bib165)) and
    text classification (Zhang et al., [2017b](#bib.bib252); Schröder and Niekler,
    [2020](#bib.bib191)), etc. Therefore, a way of maximizing the performance gain
    of the model when annotating a small number of samples is urgently required.

    gains as possible by labeling as few samples as possible. More specifically, it
    aims to select the most useful samples from the unlabeled dataset and hand it
    over to the oracle (e.g., human annotator) for labeling, to reduce the cost of
    labeling as much as possible while still maintaining performance. AL approaches
    can be divided into membership query synthesis (Angluin, [1988](#bib.bib11); King
    et al., [2004](#bib.bib114)), stream-based selective sampling (Dagan and Engelson,
    [1995](#bib.bib42); Krishnamurthy, [2002](#bib.bib119)) and pool-based (Lewis
    and Gale, [1994](#bib.bib132)) AL from application scenarios (Settles, [2009](#bib.bib194)).
    Membership query synthesis means that the learner can request to query the label
    of any unlabeled sample in the input space, including the sample generated by
    the learner. Moreover, the key difference between stream-based selective sampling
    and pool-based sampling is that the former makes an independent judgment on whether
    each sample in the data stream needs to query the labels of unlabeled samples,
    while the latter chooses the best query sample based on the evaluation and ranking
    of the entire dataset. Related research on stream-based selective sampling is
    mainly aimed at the application scenarios of small mobile devices that require
    timeliness, because these small devices often have limited storage and computing
    capabilities. The more common pool-based sampling strategy in the paper related
    to AL research is more suitable for large devices with sufficient computing and
    storage resources. In Fig.[1b](#S1.F1.sf2 "In Figure 1 ‣ 1.1\. Deep Learning ‣
    1\. Introduction ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning"), we illustrate the framework
    diagram of the pool-based active learning cycle. In the initial state, we can
    randomly select one or more samples from the unlabeled pool $U$, give this sample
    to the oracle query label to get the labeled dataset $L$, and then train the model
    on $L$ using supervised learning. Next, we use this new knowledge to select the
    next sample to be queried, add the newly queried sample to $L$, and then conduct
    training. This process is repeated until the label budget is exhausted or the
    pre-defined termination conditions are reached (see Section [3.4](#S3.SS4 "3.4\.
    DeepAL Stopping Strategy ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep Active
    Learning") for stopping strategy details).

- en: It is different from DL by using manual or automatic methods to design models
    with high-performance feature extraction capabilities. AL starts with datasets,
    primarily through the design of elaborate query rules to select the best samples
    from unlabeled datasets and query their labels, in an attempt to reduce the labeling
    cost to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, the design of query rules is
    crucial to the performance of AL methods. Related research is also quite rich.
    For example, in a given set of unlabeled datasets, the main query strategies include
    the uncertainty-based approach (Lewis and Gale, [1994](#bib.bib132); Joshi et al.,
    [2009](#bib.bib107); Ranganathan et al., [2017](#bib.bib174); Tong and Koller,
    [2002](#bib.bib223); Seung et al., [1992](#bib.bib197); Beluch et al., [2018](#bib.bib20)),
    diversity-based approach (Bilgic and Getoor, [2009](#bib.bib24); Guo, [2010](#bib.bib85);
    Nguyen and Smeulders, [2004](#bib.bib154); Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73)) and
    expected model change (Freytag et al., [2014](#bib.bib70); Roy and McCallum, [2001](#bib.bib178);
    Settles et al., [2007](#bib.bib196)). In addition, many works have also studied
    hybrid query strategies (Shui et al., [2020](#bib.bib201); Yin et al., [2017](#bib.bib245);
    Ash et al., [2020](#bib.bib15); Zhdanov, [2019](#bib.bib256)), taking into account
    the uncertainty and diversity of query samples, and attempting to find a balance
    between these two strategies. Because separate sampling based on uncertainty often
    results in sampling bias (Dasgupta, [2011](#bib.bib45); Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker,
    [2009](#bib.bib27)), the currently selected sample is not representative of the
    distribution of unlabeled datasets. On the other hand, considering only strategies
    that promote diversity in sampling may lead to increased labeling costs, as may
    be a considerable number of samples with low information content will consequently
    be selected. More classic query strategies are examined in (Settles, [2012](#bib.bib195)).
    Although there is a substantial body of existing AL-related research, AL still
    faces the problem of expanding to high-dimensional data (e.g., images, text, and
    video, etc.) (Tong, [2001](#bib.bib222)); thus, most AL works tend to concentrate
    on low-dimensional problems (Tong, [2001](#bib.bib222); Hernández-Lobato and Adams,
    [2015](#bib.bib91)). In addition, AL often queries high-value samples based on
    features extracted in advance and does not have the ability to extract features.

    samples with fewer queries in the AL context (Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73);
    Pop and Fulop, [2018](#bib.bib166); Kirsch et al., [2019](#bib.bib116); Tran et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib224)), thereby effectively alleviating the problem of the DL model
    being too confident about the output results. To solve the problem of insufficient
    labelled sample data, researchers have considered using generative networks for
    data augmentation (Tran et al., [2019](#bib.bib224)) or assigning pseudo-labels
    to high-confidence samples to expand the labeled training set (Wang et al., [2017](#bib.bib230)).
    Some researchers have also used labeled and unlabeled datasets to combine supervised
    and semisupervised training across AL cycles (Simeoni et al., [2019](#bib.bib203);
    Hossain and Roy, [2019](#bib.bib97)). In addition, the empirical research in (Sener
    and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193)) shows that the previous heuristic-based AL
    (Settles, [2009](#bib.bib194)) query strategy is invalid when it is applied to
    DL in batch settings; therefore, for the one-by-one query strategy in classic
    AL, many researchers focus on the improvement of the batch sample query strategy
    (Kirsch et al., [2019](#bib.bib116); Zhdanov, [2019](#bib.bib256); Gissin and
    Shalev-Shwartz, [2019](#bib.bib80); Ash et al., [2020](#bib.bib15)), taking both
    the amount of information and the diversity of batch samples into account. Furthermore,
    to deal with the pipeline inconsistency problem, researchers have considered modifying
    the combined framework of AL and DL to make the proposed DeepAL model as general
    as possible, an approach that can be extended to various application fields. This
    is of great significance to the promotion of DeepAL. For example, (Yoo and Kweon,
    [2019](#bib.bib246)) embeds the idea of AL into DL and consequently proposes a
    task-independent architecture design.

    complexity, it is a very popular query strategy in AL. This query strategy is
    mainly used in certain shallow models (eg, SVM (Tong and Koller, [2002](#bib.bib223))
    or KNN (Jain and Kapoor, [2009](#bib.bib103))). This is mainly because the uncertainty
    of these models can be accurately obtained by traditional uncertainty sampling
    methods. In uncertainty-based sampling, learners try to select the most uncertain
    samples to form a batch query set. For example, in the margin sampling (Scheffer
    et al., [2001](#bib.bib189)), margin $M$ is defined as the difference between
    the predicted highest probability and the predicted second highest probability
    of an sample as follows: $M=P\left(y_{1}\mid x\right)-P\left(y_{2}\mid x\right),$
    where $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are the first and second most probable labels predicted
    for the sample $x$ under the current model. The smaller the margin $M$, the greater
    the uncertainty of the sample $x$. The AL algorithm selects the top-$K$ samples
    with the smallest margin $M$ as the batch query set by calculating the margin
    $M$ of all unlabeled samples. Information entropy (Settles, [2009](#bib.bib194))
    is also a commonly used uncertainty measurement standard. For a $k$-class task,
    the information entropy $\mathbb{E}(x)$ of sample $x$ can be defined as follows:'

    Therefore, the top-$K$ samples with the largest information entropy should be
    selected. More query strategies based on uncertainty can be found in (Aggarwal
    et al., [2014](#bib.bib4)).

    methods that directly utilize an uncertainty-based sampling strategy. However,
    DFAL (DeepFool Active Learning) (Ducoffe and Precioso, [2018](#bib.bib58)) contends
    that these methods are easily fooled by adversarial examples; thus, it focuses
    on the study of examples near the decision boundary, and actively uses the information
    provided by these adversarial examples on the input spatial distribution in order
    to approximate their distance to the decision boundary. This adversarial query
    strategy can effectively improve the convergence speed of CNN training. Nevertheless,
    as analyzed in Section [3.1.1](#S3.SS1.SSS1 "3.1.1\. Batch Mode DeepAL (BMDAL)
    ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey
    of Deep Active Learning"), this can easily lead to insufficient diversity of batch
    query samples (such that relevant knowledge regarding the data distribution is
    not fully utilized), which in turn leads to low or even invalid DL model training
    performance. A feasible strategy would thus be to use a hybrid query strategy
    in a batch query, taking into account both the information volume and diversity
    of samples in either an explicit or implicit manner.

    are often excessively reliant on the measurement of similarity between samples.
    In addition, these algorithms are often only good at exploitation (learners tend
    to focus only on samples near the current decision boundary, corresponding to
    high-information query strategies), meaning that the samples in the query batch
    sample set cannot represent the true data distribution of the feature space (due
    to the insufficient diversity of batch sample sets). To address this issue, Exploration-P
    (Yin et al., [2017](#bib.bib245)) uses a deep neural network to learn the feature
    representation of the samples, then explicitly calculates the similarity between
    the samples. At the same time, the processes of exploitation and exploration (in
    the early days of model training, learners used random sampling strategies for
    exploration purposes) are balanced to enable more accurate measurement of the
    similarity between samples. More specifically, Exploration-P uses the information
    entropy in Equation ([5](#S3.E5 "In 3.1.2\. Uncertainty-based and Hybrid Query
    Strategies ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning

    information volume and diversity under the mini-batch sample query setting. DMBAL
    (Zhdanov, [2019](#bib.bib256)) can easily achieve expansion from the generalized
    linear model to DL; this not only increases the scalability of DMBAL (Zhdanov,
    [2019](#bib.bib256)) but also increases the diversity of active query samples
    in the mini-batch. Fig.[2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.1.1\. Batch Mode DeepAL (BMDAL)

    query strategy is quite popular. For example, WI-DL (Weighted Incremental Dictionary
    Learning) (Liu et al., [2017](#bib.bib136)) mainly considers the two stages of
    DBN. In the unsupervised feature learning stage, the key consideration is the
    representativeness of the data, while in the supervised fine-tuning stage, the
    uncertainty of the data is considered; these two indicators are then integrated,
    and finally optimized using the proposed weighted incremental dictionary learning
    algorithm.

- en: 'Although the above improvements have resulted in a good performance, there
    is still a hidden danger that must be addressed: namely, that, diversity-based
    strategies are not appropriate for all datasets. More specifically, the richer
    the category content of the dataset, the larger the batch size, and the better
    the effect of diversity-based methods; by contrast, an uncertainty-based query
    strategy will perform better with smaller batch sizes and less rich content. These
    characteristics depend on the statistical characteristics of the dataset. The
    BMAL context, whether the data are unfamiliar and potentially unstructured, makes
    it impossible to determine which AL query strategy is more appropriate. In light
    of this, BADGE (Batch Active learning by Diverse Gradient Embeddings) (Ash et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib15)) samples point groups that are disparate and high magnitude
    when represented in a hallucinated gradient space, meaning that both the prediction
    uncertainty of the model and the diversity of the samples in a batch are considered
    simultaneously. Most importantly, BADGE can achieve an automatic balance between
    forecast uncertainty and sample diversity without the need for manual hyperparameter
    adjustments. Moreover, while BADGE (Ash et al., [2020](#bib.bib15)) considers
    this hybrid query strategy in an implicit way, WAAL (Wasserstein Adversarial Active
    Learning) (Shui et al., [2020](#bib.bib201)) proposes a hybrid query strategy
    that explicitly balances uncertainty and diversity. In addition, WAAL (Shui et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib201)) uses Wasserstein distance to model the interactive procedure
    in AL as a distribution matching problem, derives losses from it, and then decomposes
    WAAL (Shui et al., [2020](#bib.bib201)) into two stages: DNN parameter optimization
    and query batch selection. TA-VAAL (Task-Aware Variational Adversarial Active
    Learning) (Kim et al., [2020](#bib.bib113)) also explores the balance of this
    hybrid query strategy. The assumption underpinning TA-VAAL is that the uncertainty-based
    method does not make good use of the overall data distribution, while the data
    distribution-based method often ignores the structure of the task. Consequently,
    TA-VAAL proposes to integrate the loss prediction module (Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246))
    and the concept of RankCGAN (Saquil et al., [2018](#bib.bib186)) into VAAL (Variational
    Adversarial Active Learning) (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)), enabling both
    the data distribution and the model uncertainty to be considered. TA-VAAL has
    achieved good performance on various balanced and unbalanced benchmark datasets.

    Neural Networks) (Gal and Ghahramani, [2015](#bib.bib71)) with AL methods to adapt
    BALD (Houlsby et al., [2011](#bib.bib98)) to the deep learning environment, thereby
    developing a new AL framework for high-dimensional data. This approach adopts
    the above method to first perform Gaussian prior modeling on the weights of a
    CNN, and then uses variational inference to obtain the posterior distribution
    of network prediction. In addition, in practice, researchers often also use a
    powerful and low-cost MC-dropout (Monte-Carlo dropout) (Srivastava et al., [2014](#bib.bib213))
    stochastic regularization technique to obtain posterior samples, consequently
    attaining good performance on real-world datasets (Leibig et al., [2017](#bib.bib131);
    Kendall et al., [2017](#bib.bib112)). Moreover, this regularization technique
    has been proven to be equivalent to variational inference (Gal and Ghahramani,
    [2016](#bib.bib72)). However, a core-set approach (Sener and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193))
    points out that DBAL (Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73)) is unsuitable for large
    datasets due to the need for batch sampling. It should be noted here that while
    DBAL (Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73)) allows the use of dropout in testing for
    better confidence estimation, the analysis presented in (Gissin and Shalev-Shwartz,
    [2019](#bib.bib80)) contends that the performance of this method is similar to
    the performance of using neural network SR (Wang et al., [2017](#bib.bib230))
    as uncertainty sampling, which requires vigilance. In addition, DEBAL (Deep Ensemble
    Bayesian Active Learning) (Pop and Fulop, [2018](#bib.bib166)) argues that the
    pattern collapse phenomenon (Srivastava et al., [2017](#bib.bib212)) in the variational
    inference method leads to the overconfident prediction characteristic of the DBAL
    method. For this reason, DEBAL combines the expressive power of ensemble methods
    with MC-dropout to obtain better uncertainty in the absence of trading representativeness.
    For its part, BatchBALD (Kirsch et al., [2019](#bib.bib116)) opts to expand BALD
    (Houlsby et al., [2011](#bib.bib98)) to the batch query context; this approach
    no longer calculates the mutual information between a single sample and model
    parameters but rather recalculates the mutual information between the batch samples
    and the model parameters to jointly score the batch of samples. This enables BatchBALD
    to more accurately evaluate the joint mutual information. Inspired by the latest
    research on Bayesian core sets (Huggins et al., [2016](#bib.bib100); Campbell
    and Broderick, [2019](#bib.bib34)), ACS-FW (Active Bayesian CoreSets with Frank-Wolfe
    optimization) (Pinsler et al., [2019](#bib.bib163)) reconstructed the batch structure
    to optimize the sparse subset approximation of the log-posterior induced by the
    entire dataset. Using this similarity, ACS-FW then employs the Frank-Wolfe (Frank
    et al., [1956](#bib.bib69)) algorithm to enable effective Bayesian AL at scale,
    while its use of random projection has made it still more popular. Compared with
    other query strategies (e.g., maximizing the predictive entropy (MAXENT) (Sener
    and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193); Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73)) and BALD (Houlsby
    et al., [2011](#bib.bib98))), ACS-FW achieves better coverage across the entire
    data manifold. DPEs (Deep Probabilistic Ensembles) (Chitta et al., [2018](#bib.bib40))
    introduces an expandable DPEs technology, which uses a regularized ensemble to
    approximate the deep BNN, and then evaluates the classification effect of these
    DPEs in a series of large-scale visual AL experiments.

    learning (Gal and Ghahramani, [2016](#bib.bib72); Welling and Teh, [2011](#bib.bib237)).
    Adopting the Bayesian view of the existing neural link predictors, it expands
    the uncertainty sampling method by using the basic structure of the knowledge
    graph, thereby creating a novel DeepAL method. ActiveLink further noted that although
    AL can sample efficiently, the model needs to be retrained from scratch for each
    iteration in the AL process, which is unacceptable in the DL model training context.
    A simple solution would be to use newly selected data to train the model incrementally,
    or to combine it with existing training data (Shen et al., [2017](#bib.bib200));
    however, this would cause the model to be biased either towards a small amount
    of newly selected data or towards data selected early in the process. In order
    to solve this bias problem, ActiveLink adopts a principled and unbiased incremental
    training method based on meta-learning. More specifically, in each AL iteration,
    ActiveLink uses the newly selected samples to update the model parameters, then
    approximates the meta-objective of the model’s future prediction by generalizing
    the model based on the samples selected in the previous iteration. This enables
    ActiveLink to strike a balance between the importance of the newly and previously
    selected data, and thereby to achieve an unbiased estimation of the model parameters.

    activation over a representation layer to query consecutive points from the pool.
    It is worth noting here that FF-Active (Geifman and El-Yaniv, [2017](#bib.bib76))
    and Exploration-P (Yin et al., [2017](#bib.bib245)) resemble the way in which
    random queries are used in the early stages of AL to enhance AL’s exploration
    ability, which prevents AL from falling into the trap of insufficient sample diversity.
    Similarly, to solve the sampling bias problem in batch querying, the diversity
    of batch query samples is increased. The Core-set approach (Sener and Savarese,
    [2018](#bib.bib193)) attempts to solve this problem by constructing a core subset.
    A further attempt was made to solve the k-Center problem (Farahani and Hekmatfar,
    [2009](#bib.bib63)) by building a core subset so that the model learned on the
    selected core set will be more competitive than the rest of the data. However,
    the Core-set approach requires a large distance matrix to be built on the unlabeled
    dataset, meaning that this search process is computationally expensive; this disadvantage
    will become more apparent on large-scale unlabeled datasets (Ash et al., [2020](#bib.bib15)).

- en: Active Palmprint Recognition (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)) applies DeepAL
    to high-dimensional and complex palmprint recognition data. Similar to the core
    set concept, (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)) regards AL as a binary classification
    task. It is expected that the labeled and unlabeled sample sets will have the
    same data distribution, making the two difficult to distinguish; that is, the
    goal is to find a labeled core subset with the same distribution as the original
    dataset. More specifically, due to the heuristic generative model simulation data
    distribution being difficult to train and unsuitable for high-dimensional and
    complex data such as palm prints, the author considers whether the sample can
    be positively distinguished from the unlabeled or labeled dataset with a high
    degree of confidence. Those samples that can be clearly distinguished are obviously
    different from the data distribution of the core annotation subset. These samples
    will then be added to the annotation dataset for the next round of training. Previous
    core-set-based methods (Geifman and El-Yaniv, [2017](#bib.bib76); Sener and Savarese,
    [2018](#bib.bib193)) often simply try to query data points as far as possible
    to cover all points of the data manifold without considering the density, which
    results in the queried data points overly representing sample points from manifold
    sparse areas. Similar to (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)), DAL (Discriminative
    Active Learning) (Gissin and Shalev-Shwartz, [2019](#bib.bib80)) also regards
    AL as a binary classification task and further aims to make the queried labeled
    dataset indistinguishable from the unlabeled dataset. The key advantage of DAL
    (Gissin and Shalev-Shwartz, [2019](#bib.bib80)) is that it can sample from the
    unlabeled dataset in proportion to the data density, without biasing the sample
    points in the sparse popular domain. Moreover, the method proposed by DAL (Gissin
    and Shalev-Shwartz, [2019](#bib.bib80)) is not limited to classification tasks,
    which are conceptually easy to transfer to other new tasks.

    expanding the query scale of AL for large-scale sampling (10k or 500k samples
    at a time). Moreover, by integrating hundreds of models and reusing intermediate
    checkpoints, the distributed searching of training data on large-scale labeled
    datasets can be efficiently realized with a small computational cost. (Chitta
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib39)) also proved that the performance of using the entire
    dataset for training is not the upper limit of performance, as well as that AL
    based on subsets specifically may yield better performance.

    common datasets and proposes a general data analysis tool design to facilitate
    a better understanding of the diversity of training examples in the dataset. GA
    (Vodrahalli et al., [2018](#bib.bib226)) finds that not all datasets can be trained
    on a small sub-sample set because the relative difference of sample importance
    in some datasets is almost negligible; therefore, it is not advisable to blindly
    use smaller sub-datasets in the AL context. In addition, (Beluch et al., [2018](#bib.bib20))
    finds that compared with the Bayesian deep learning approach (Monte-Carlo dropout
    (Gal et al., [2017](#bib.bib73))) and density-based (Sener and Savarese, [2017](#bib.bib192))
    methods, ensemble-based AL can effectively offset the imbalance of categories

    uncertainty, and thus better performance.

    as a reinforcement learning problem and introduces a new description through a
    clear selection strategy. In addition, some researchers have also noted that,
    in traditional AL workflows, the acquisition function is often regarded as a fixed
    known prior, and that it will not be known whether this acquisition function is
    appropriate until the label budget is exhausted. This makes it impossible to flexibly
    and quickly tune the acquisition function. Accordingly, one good option may be
    to use reinforcement learning to dynamically tune the acquisition function. RAL
    (Reinforced Active Learning) (Haußmann et al., [2019](#bib.bib87)) proposes to
    use BNN as a learning predictor for acquisition functions. As such, all probability
    information provided by the BNN predictor will be combined to obtain a comprehensive
    probability distribution; subsequently, the probability distribution is sent to
    a BNN probabilistic policy network, which performs reinforcement learning in each
    labeling round based on the oracle feedback. This feedback will fine-tune the
    acquisition function, thereby continuously improving its quality. DRAL (Deep Reinforcement
    Active Learning) (Liu et al., [2019](#bib.bib137)) adopts a similar idea and designs
    a deep reinforcement active learning framework for the person Re-ID task. This
    approach uses the idea of reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the acquisition
    function so as to obtain high-quality query samples. Fig.[4](#S3.F4 "Figure 4
    ‣ 3.1.4\. Density-based Methods ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL
    ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning") presents a comparison
    between traditional AL, RAL and DRAL pipelines. The pipeline of AL is shown in
    Fig.[4a](#S3.F4.sf1 "In Figure 4 ‣ 3.1.4\. Density-based Methods ‣ 3.1\. Query
    Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep
    Active Learning"). The standard AL pipeline usually consists of three parts. The
    oracle provides a set of labeled data; the predictor (here, BNN) is used to learn
    these data and provides predictable uncertainty for the guide. The guide is usually
    a fixed, hard-coded acquisition function that picks the next sample for the oracle
    to restart the cycle. The pipeline of RAL (Reinforced Active Learning) (Haußmann
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib87)) is shown in Fig.[4b](#S3.F4.sf2 "In Figure 4 ‣ 3.1.4\.
    Density-based Methods ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep
    Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning"). RAL replaces the fixed acquisition
    function with the policy BNN. The policy BNN learns in a probabilistic manner,
    obtains feedback from the oracle, and learns how to select the next optimal sample
    point (new parts in red) in a reinforcement learning-based manner. Therefore,
    RAL can adjust the acquisition function more flexibly to adapt to the existing
    dataset. The pipeline of DRAL (Deep Reinforcement Active Learning) (Liu et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib137)) is shown in Fig.[4c](#S3.F4.sf3 "In Figure 4 ‣ 3.1.4\. Density-based
    Methods ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning
    ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning"). DRAL utilizes a deep reinforcement active
    learning framework for the person Re-ID task. For each query anchor (probe), the
    agent (reinforcement active learner) will select sequential instances from the
    gallery pool during the active learning process and hand it to the oracle to obtain
    manual annotation with binary feedback (positive/negative). The state evaluates
    the similarity relationships between all instances and calculates rewards based
    on oracle feedback to adjust agent queries.

    Representation Active Learning) (Mottaghi and Yeung, [2019](#bib.bib147)) borrowed
    from several previous methods (Liu et al., [2017](#bib.bib136); Zhu and Bento,
    [2017](#bib.bib260); Tran et al., [2019](#bib.bib224)) not only to train the network
    using labeled and unlabeled datasets but also to introduce generative adversarial
    learning into the network architecture for data augmentation purposes, thereby
    further improving the learning ability of the network. In more detail, VAAL (Sinha
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)) noticed that the batch-based query strategy based
    on uncertainty not only readily leads to insufficient sample diversity, but is
    also highly susceptible to interference from outliers. In addition, density-based
    methods (Sener and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193)) are susceptible to $p$-norm
    limitations when applied to high-dimensional data, resulting in calculation distances
    that are too concentrated (Donoho et al., [2000](#bib.bib55)). To this end, VAAL
    (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)) proposes to use the adversarial learning representation
    method to distinguish between the potential spatial coding features of labeled
    and unlabeled data, thus reducing interference from outliers. VAAL (Sinha et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib205)) also uses labeled and unlabeled data to jointly train a VAE
    (Kingma and Welling, [2014](#bib.bib115); Sohn et al., [2015](#bib.bib209)) in
    a semi-supervised manner; the goal here is to deceive the adversarial network
    (Goodfellow et al., [2014](#bib.bib81)) into predicting that all data points come
    from the labeled pool, in order to solve the problem of distance concentration.
    VAAL (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)) can learn an effective low-dimensional
    latent representation on a large-scale dataset, and further provides an effective
    sampling method by jointly learning the representation form and uncertainty.

    et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)), aiming to use as few manual annotation samples as
    possible while still making full use of the existing or generated data information
    in order to improve the model’s learning ability. In addition to using labeled
    and unlabeled datasets, ARAL (Mottaghi and Yeung, [2019](#bib.bib147)) also uses
    samples produced by deep production networks to jointly train the entire model.
    ARAL (Mottaghi and Yeung, [2019](#bib.bib147)) comprises both VAAL (Sinha et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib205)) and adversarial representation learning (Donahue and Simonyan,
    [2019](#bib.bib54)). By using VAAL (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib205)) to learn
    the potential feature representation space of the labeled and unlabeled data,
    the unlabeled samples with the largest amount of information can be selected accordingly.
    At the same time, both real and generated data are used to enhance the model’s
    learning ability through confrontational representation learning (Donahue and
    Simonyan, [2019](#bib.bib54)). Similarly, TA-VAAL (Kim et al., [2020](#bib.bib113))
    also extends VAAL by using the global data structure from VAAL and local task-related
    information from the learning loss for sample querying purposes. We present the
    framework of ARAL (Mottaghi and Yeung, [2019](#bib.bib147)) in Fig.[7](#S3.F7

    representation learning, SSAL (Semi-Supervised Active Learning) (Simeoni et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib203)) implements a new training method. More specifically, SSAL
    (Simeoni et al., [2019](#bib.bib203)) uses unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised
    learning methods across AL cycles, and makes full use of existing information
    for training without increasing the cost of labeling as much as possible. In more
    detail, the process is as follows: before the AL starts, first use labeled and
    unlabeled data for unsupervised pretraining. In each AL learning cycle, first,
    perform supervised training on the labeled dataset, then perform semi-supervised
    training on all datasets. This represents an attempt to devise a wholly new training
    method. The author finds that, compared with the difference between the sampling

    exists between AL and DL; thus, only fine-tuning the DL model in the AL framework,
    or simply combining AL and DL to treat them as two separate problems, may cause
    divergence. For example, (Asghar et al., [2017](#bib.bib14)) first conducts offline
    supervised training of the DL model on two different types of session datasets
    to grant basic conversational capabilities to the backbone network, then enables
    the online AL stage to interact with human users, enabling the model to be improved
    in an open way based on user feedback. AL-DL (Wang and Shang, [2014](#bib.bib228))
    proposes an AL method for DL models with DBNs, while ADN (Zhou et al., [2010](#bib.bib258))
    further proposes an active deep network architecture for sentiment classification.
    (Stark et al., [2015](#bib.bib214)) proposes an AL algorithm using CNN for captcha
    recognition. However, generally speaking, the above methods first perform routine
    supervised training on this depth model on the labeled dataset, then actively
    sample based on the output of the depth model. There are many similar related
    works (Shelmanov et al., [2019](#bib.bib199); Feng et al., [2019](#bib.bib64))
    that adopt this split-and-splitting approach that treats the training of AL and
    deep models as two independent problems and consequently increases the possibility,
    which the two problems will diverge. Although this method achieved some success
    at the time, a general framework that closely combines the two tasks of DL and
    AL would play a vital role in the performance improvement and promotion of DeepAL.

    and consequently proposes a novel DeepAL framework. It sends samples from the
    unlabeled dataset to the CNN step by step, after which the CNN classifier outputs
    two types of samples: a small number of uncertain samples and a large number of
    samples with high prediction confidence. A small number of uncertain samples are
    labeled by the oracle, and the CNN classifier is used to automatically assign
    pseudo-labels to a large number of high-prediction-confidence samples. Then, these
    two types of samples are used to fine-tune the CNN and the update process is repeated.

    Lv et al., [2020](#bib.bib141)) , among others. More specifically, (Yang et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib244)) proposes a framework that uses an FCN (Fully Convolutional
    Network) (Long et al., [2015](#bib.bib138)) and AL to solve the medical image
    segmentation problem using a small number of annotations. It first trains FCN
    on a small number of labeled datasets, then extracts the features of the unlabeled
    datasets through FCN, using these features to estimate the uncertainty and similarity
    of unlabeled samples. This strategy, which is similar to that described in Section
    [3.1.2](#S3.SS1.SSS2 "3.1.2\. Uncertainty-based and Hybrid Query Strategies ‣
    3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey
    of Deep Active Learning"), helps to select highly uncertain and diverse samples
    to be added to the labeled dataset in order to start the next stage of training.
    Active Palmprint Recognition (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)) proposes a similar
    DeepAL framework as that for the palmprint recognition task. The difference is
    that inspired by domain adaptation (Bendavid et al., [2010](#bib.bib21)), Active
    Palmprint Recognition (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)) regards AL as a binary classification
    task: it is expected that the labeled and unlabeled sample sets have the same
    data distribution, making the two difficult to distinguish. Supervision training
    can be performed directly on a small number of labeled datasets, which reduces
    the burden associated with labeling. (Lv et al., [2020](#bib.bib141)) proposes
    a DeepAL framework for defect detection. This approach performs uncertainty sampling
    based on the output features of the detection model to generate a list of candidate
    samples for annotation. In order to further take the diversity of defect categories
    in the samples into account, (Lv et al., [2020](#bib.bib141)) designs an average
    margin method to control the sampling ratio of each defect category.'

    model to be used as the basis for determining the uncertainty or diversity of
    the sample (Active Palmprint Recognition (Du et al., [2019](#bib.bib57)) uses
    the output of the first fully connected layer). (He et al., [2019a](#bib.bib89);
    Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246); Zhao et al., [2020](#bib.bib255)) also used
    the output of the DL model’s middle hidden layer. As analyzed in Section [3.1.2](#S3.SS1.SSS2
    "3.1.2\. Uncertainty-based and Hybrid Query Strategies ‣ 3.1\. Query Strategy
    Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning")
    and Section [2](#S2 "2\. The necessity and challenge of combining DL and AL ‣
    A Survey of Deep Active Learning"), due to the difference in learning paradigms
    between the deep and shallow models, the traditional uncertainty-based query strategy
    cannot be directly applied to the DL model. In addition, unlike the shallow model,
    the deep model can be regarded as composed of two stages, namely the feature extraction
    stage and the task learning stage. It is inaccurate to use only the output of
    the last layer of the DL model as the basis for evaluating the sample prediction
    uncertainty; this is because the uncertainty of the DL model is in fact composed
    of the uncertainty of these two stages. A schematic diagram of this concept is
    presented in Fig.[8](#S3.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ 3.3\. DeepAL Generic Framework ‣ 3\. Deep
    Active Learning ‣ A Survey of Deep Active Learning"). To this end, AL-MV (Active
    Learning with Multiple Views) (He et al., [2019a](#bib.bib89)) treats the features
    from different hidden layers in the middle of CNN as multiview data, taking the
    uncertainty of both stages into account, and the AL-MV algorithm is designed to
    implement adaptive weighting of the uncertainty of each layer, to enable more
    accurate measurement of the sampling uncertainty. LLAL (Learning Loss for Active
    Learning) (Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246)) also used a similar idea. More
    specifically, LLAL designs a small parameter module of the loss prediction module
    to attach to the target network, using the output of multiple hidden layers of
    the target network as the input of the loss prediction module. The loss prediction
    module is learned to predict the target loss of the unlabeled dataset, while the
    top-$K$ strategy is used to select the query samples. LLAL achieves task-agnostic
    AL framework design at a small parameter cost and further achieves competitive
    performance on a variety of mainstream visual tasks (namely, image classification,
    target detection, and human pose estimation). Similarly, (Zhao et al., [2020](#bib.bib255))
    uses a similar strategy to implement a DeepAL framework for finger bone segmentation
    tasks. (Zhao et al., [2020](#bib.bib255)) uses Deeply Supervised U-Net (Ronneberger
    et al., [2015](#bib.bib176)) as the segmentation network, then subsequently uses
    the output of the multilevel segmentation hidden layer and the output of the last
    layer as the input of AL; this input information is then integrated to form the
    basis for the evaluation of the sample information size. We take LLAL (Yoo and
    Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246)) as an example to explicate the overall network structure
    of this idea in Fig.[9](#S3.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ 3.3\. DeepAL Generic Framework ‣ 3\.

    and promotion of DeepAL, as this task-independent framework can be conveniently
    transplanted to other fields. In the current fusion of DL and AL, DL is primarily
    responsible for feature extraction, while AL is mainly responsible for sample
    querying; thus, a deeper and tighter fusion will help DeepAL achieve better performance.
    Of course, this will require additional exploration and effort on the part of
    researchers. Finally, the challenges of combining DL and AL and related work on

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to querying strategies and training methods, an appropriate stopping
    strategy has an important impact on DeepAL performance. At present, most DeepALs
    (Liu et al., [2017](#bib.bib136); Maldonado and Harabagiu, [2019](#bib.bib142);
    Folmsbee et al., [2018](#bib.bib67); Budd et al., [2019](#bib.bib31); Schröder
    and Niekler, [2020](#bib.bib191)) often use the predefined stopping criterion,
    and when the criterion is satisfied, they stop querying labels from the oracle.
    These predefined stopping criteria include the maximum number of iterations, the
    minimum threshold for changing classification accuracy, the minimum number of
    labeled samples, and the expected accuracy value, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although these stopping criteria are simple, these predefined stopping criteria
    are likely to cause DeepAL to fail to achieve optimal performance. This is because
    the premature termination of AL annotation querying leads to large performance
    losses in the model, and excessive annotation behavior wastes a lot of annotation
    budget. Therefore, Stabilizing Predictions (SP) (Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker,
    [2014](#bib.bib28)) makes a comprehensive review of AL stopping strategies and
    proposes an AL stopping strategy based on stability prediction. Specifically,
    the SP predivides a part of the samples from the unlabeled dataset to form a stop
    set (the stop set does not need to be labeled), and the SP checks the prediction
    stability on the stop set in each iteration. When the prediction performance of
    the model on the stop set stabilizes, the iteration is stopped. A well-trained
    model often has a stable predictive ability, and SP takes advantage of this feature.
    The predivided stop set does not require specific labeling information, which
    avoids additional labeling costs contrary to the purpose of AL. Although SP is
    a stopping strategy proposed mainly for AL, it also is relevant for DeepAL.

    poorly) and obtain satisfactory performance at the smallest possible labeling
    cost.

    to samples with high confidence and adds them to the highly uncertain sample set
    queried using the uncertainty-based AL method, then uses the expanded training
    set to train the DeepAL model image classifier. (Ranganathan et al., [2017](#bib.bib174))
    first integrated the criteria of AL into the deep belief network and subsequently
    conducted extensive research on classification tasks on a variety of real uni-modal
    and multi-modal datasets. WI-DL (Liu et al., [2017](#bib.bib136)) uses the DeepAL
    method to simultaneously consider the two selection criteria of maximizing representativeness
    and uncertainty on hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets for remote sensing classification
    tasks. Similarly, (Lin et al., [2018](#bib.bib134); Deng et al., [2019](#bib.bib49))
    also studied the classification of HSI. (Lin et al., [2018](#bib.bib134)) introduces
    AL to initialize HSI and then performs transfer learning. This work also recommends
    constructing and connecting higher-level features to source and target HSI data
    in order to further overcome the cross-domain disparity. (Deng et al., [2019](#bib.bib49))
    proposes a unified deep network combined with active transfer learning, thereby
    training the HSI classification well while using less labeled training data.

    et al., [2018](#bib.bib67)) explores the use of AL rather than random learning
    to train convolutional neural networks for tissue (e.g., stroma, lymphocytes,
    tumor, mucosa, keratin pearls, blood, and background/adipose) classification tasks.
    (Budd et al., [2019](#bib.bib31)) conducted a comprehensive review of DeepAL-related
    methods in the field of medical image analysis. As discussed above, since the
    annotation of medical images requires strong professional knowledge, it is usually
    both very difficult and very expensive to find well-trained experts willing to
    perform annotations. In addition, DL has achieved impressive performance on various
    image feature tasks. Therefore, a large number of works continue to focus on combining
    DL and AL in order to apply DeepAL to the field of medical image analysis (Du
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib56); Sayantan et al., [2018](#bib.bib187); Chen et al.,

    However, these fields are also limited by the higher sample labeling cost. Thus,

    uses deep neural networks to quickly transferable and automatically extract information,
    and further combines transfer learning and AL to design a DeepAL framework for
    species identification and counting in camera trap images. (Kellenberger et al.,

    wildlife detection purposes; moreover, to enable this wildlife detector to be
    reused, (Kellenberger et al., [2019](#bib.bib111)) uses AL and introduces transfer
    sampling (TS) to find the corresponding area between the source and target datasets,
    thereby facilitating the transfer of data to the target domain. (Feng et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib64)) proposes a DeepAL framework for deep object detection in autonomous
    driving to train LiDAR 3D object detectors. (Lv et al., [2020](#bib.bib141)) proposes
    the adaptation of a widespread DeepAL framework to defect detection in real industries,
    along with an uncertainty sampling method for use in generating candidate label

    improve the image segmentation performance on a limited labeled dataset. (Yang
    et al., [2017](#bib.bib244)) combines FCN and AL to create a DeepAL framework
    for biological-image segmentation. This work uses the uncertainty and similarity
    information provided by the FCN to extend the maximum set cover problem, significantly
    reducing the required labeling workload by pointing out the most effective labeling
    areas. DASL (Deep Active Self-paced Learning) (Wang et al., [2018b](#bib.bib234))
    proposes a deep region-based network, Nodules R-CNN, for pulmonary nodule segmentation
    tasks. This work generates segmentation masks for use as examples, and at the
    same time, combines AL and SPL (Self-Paced Learning) (Kumar et al., [2010](#bib.bib122))
    to propose a new deep active self-paced learning strategy that reduces the labeling
    workload. (Wang et al., [2019a](#bib.bib233)) proposes a Nodule-plus Region-based
    CNN for pulmonary nodule detection and segmentation in 3D thoracic Computed Tomography
    (CT). This work combines AL and SPL strategies to create a new deep self-paced
    active learning (DSAL) strategy, which reduces the annotation workload and makes
    effective use of unannotated data. (Zhao et al., [2020](#bib.bib255)) further
    proposes a new deep-supervised active learning method for finger bone segmentation
    tasks. This model can be fine-tuned in an iterative and incremental learning manner

    model, DeActive requires fewer labeled samples, consumes fewer resources, and
    achieves high recognition accuracy. (Wang et al., [2018a](#bib.bib231)) minimizes
    the annotation cost of the video-based person Re-ID dataset by integrating AL

    ability to process high-dimensional image data and conduct automatic feature extraction
    but also AL’s potential to effectively reduce annotation costs. DeepAL, therefore,
    has fascinating potential especially in areas where labels require high levels
    of expertise and are difficult to obtain.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most recent work reveals that DeepAL has been successful in many common tasks.
    DeepAL has attracted the interest of a large number of researchers by reducing
    the cost of annotation and its ability to implement the powerful feature extraction
    capabilities of DL; consequently, the related research work is also extremely
    rich. However, there are still a large number of unanswered questions on this
    subject. As (Munjal et al., [2020](#bib.bib149)) discovered, the results reported
    on the random sampling baseline (RSB) differ significantly between different studies.
    For example, under the same settings, using 20% of the label data of CIFAR 10,
    the RSB performance reported by (Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246)) is 13% higher
    than that in (Tran et al., [2019](#bib.bib224)). Secondly, the same DeepAL method
    may yield different results in different studies. For example, using 40% of the
    label data of CIFAR 100 (Krizhevsky et al., [2009](#bib.bib120)) and VGG16 (Simonyan
    and Zisserman, [2015](#bib.bib204)) as the extraction network, the reported results
    of (Sener and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193)) and (Sinha et al., [2019](#bib.bib205))
    differ by 8%. Furthermore, the latest DeepAL research also exhibits some inconsistencies.
    For example, (Sener and Savarese, [2018](#bib.bib193)) and (Ducoffe and Precioso,
    [2018](#bib.bib58)) point out that diversity-based methods have always been better
    than uncertainty-based methods, and that uncertainty-based methods perform worse
    than RSB; however, the latest research of (Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246))
    shows that this is not the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compared with AL’s strategic selection of high-value samples, RSB has been regarded
    as a strong baseline (Yoo and Kweon, [2019](#bib.bib246); Sener and Savarese,
    [2018](#bib.bib193)). However, the above problems reveal an urgent need to design
    a general performance evaluation platform for DeepAL work, as well as to determine
    a unified high-performance RSB. Secondly, the reproducibility of different DeepAL
    methods is also an important issue. The highly reproducible DeepAL method helps
    to evaluate the performance of different DALs. A common evaluation platform should
    be used for experiments under consistent settings, and snapshots of experimental
    settings should be shared. In addition, multiple repetitive experiments with different
    initializations under the same experimental conditions should be implemented,
    as this could effectively avoid misleading conclusions caused by experimental
    setup problems. Researchers should pay sufficient attention to these inconsistent
    studies to enable them to clarify the principles involved. On the other hand,
    adequate ablation experiments and transfer experiments are also necessary. The
    former will make it easier for us to determine which improvements bring about
    performance gains, while the latter can help to ensure that the AL selection strategy
    does indeed enable the indiscriminate selection of high-value samples for the
    dataset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The current research directions regarding DeepAL methods focus primarily on
    the improvement of AL selection strategies, the optimization of training methods,
    and the improvement of task-independent models. As noted in Section [3.1](#S3.SS1
    "3.1\. Query Strategy Optimization in DeepAL ‣ 3\. Deep Active Learning ‣ A Survey
    of Deep Active Learning"), the improvement of AL selection strategy is currently
    centered around taking into account the query strategy based on uncertainty and
    diversity explicitly or implicitly. Moreover, hybrid selection strategies are
    increasingly favored by researchers. Moreover, the optimization of training methods
    mainly focuses on labeled datasets, unlabeled datasets, or the use of methods
    such as GAN to expand data, as well as the hybrid training method of unsupervised,
    semi-supervised, and supervised learning across the AL cycle. This training method
    promises to deliver even more performance improvements than are thought to be
    achievable through changes to the selection strategy. In fact, this makes up for
    the issues of the DL model requiring a large number of labeled training samples
    and the AL selecting a limited number of labeled samples. In addition, the use
    of unlabeled or generated datasets is also conducive to making full use of existing
    information without adding to the annotation costs. Furthermore, the incremental
    training method is also an important research direction. From a computing resource
    perspective, it is unacceptable to train a deep model from scratch in each cycle.
    While simple incremental training will cause the deviation of model parameters,
    the huge potential savings on resources are quite attractive. Although related
    research remains quite scarce, this is still a very promising research direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Task independence is also an important research direction, as it helps to make
    DeepAL models more directly and widely extensible to other tasks. However, the
    related research remains insufficient, and the corresponding DeepAL methods tend
    to focus only on the uncertainty-based selection method. Because DL itself is
    easier to integrate with the uncertainty-based AL selection strategy, we believe
    that uncertainty-based methods will continue to dominate research directions not
    related to these tasks in the future. On the other hand, it may also be advisable
    to explicitly take the diversity-based selection strategy into account; of course,
    this will also give rise to great challenges. In addition, it should be pointed
    out that blindly pursuing the idea of training models on smaller subsets would
    be unwise, as the relative difference in sample importance in some datasets with
    a large variety of content and a large number of samples can almost be ignored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no conflict between the above-mentioned improvement directions; thus,
    a mixed improvement strategy is an important development direction for the future.
    In general, DeepAL research has significant practical application value in terms
    of both labeling costs and application scenarios; however, DeepAL research remains
    in its infancy at present, and there is still a long way to go in the future.

    learning and deep learning have been comprehensively analyzed and summarized.
    In response to these challenges, we analyze and compare existing work from three
    perspectives: query strategy optimization, labeled sample data expansion, and
    model generality. In addition, we also summarize the stopping strategy of DeepAL.
    Then, we review the related work of DeepAL from the perspective of the application.
    Finally, we conduct a comprehensive discussion on the future direction of DeepAL.
    As far as we know, this is the first comprehensive and systematic review in the
    field of deep active learning.'
