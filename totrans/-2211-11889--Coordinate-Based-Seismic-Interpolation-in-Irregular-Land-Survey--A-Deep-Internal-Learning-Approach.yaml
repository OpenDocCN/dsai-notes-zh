- en: Physical and budget constraints often result in irregular sampling, which complicates
    accurate subsurface imaging. Pre-processing approaches, such as missing trace
    or shot interpolation, are typically employed to enhance seismic data in such
    cases. Recently, deep learning has been used to address the trace interpolation
    problem at the expense of large amounts of training data to adequately represent
    typical seismic events. Nonetheless, most research in this area has focused on
    trace reconstruction, with little attention having been devoted to shot interpolation.
    Furthermore, existing methods assume regularly spaced receivers/sources failing
    in approximating seismic data from real (irregular) surveys. This work presents
    a novel shot gather interpolation approach which uses a continuous coordinate-based
    representation of the acquired seismic wavefield parameterized by a neural network.
    The proposed unsupervised approach, which we call coordinate-based seismic interpolation
    (CoBSI), enables the prediction of specific seismic characteristics in irregular
    land surveys without using external data during neural network training. Experimental
    results on real and synthetic 3D data validate the ability of the proposed method
    to estimate continuous smooth seismic events in the time-space and frequency-wavenumber
    domains, improving sparsity or low-rank-based interpolation methods.

- en: Interpolation is of great importance within the seismic data processing workflow
    because environmental or topographic restrictions usually result in incomplete
    and irregular receiver and source sampling. Some limitations include natural and
    anthropological factors such as water bodies, and infrastructure, as well as equipment
    errors [[1](#bib.bib1)]. The most common seismic interpolation approach involves
    recovering missing traces of a shot gather. A more complex approach focuses on
    estimating complete missing shot gathers, entailing greater economic, environmental,
    and implementation benefits. Nonetheless, most of the work reported in the literature
    deals with trace interpolation, with limited consideration having been given to
    shot interpolation. Thus, this work focuses on interpolating missing seismic shots
    in irregularly sampled land surveys.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shot interpolation has typically been addressed by convex optimization, aiming
    at inverting the acquisition model using a regularizer that imposes prior knowledge
    about the data such as sparsity in domains like wavelet, curvelet, shearlet and
    learned dictionaries [[2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3), [4](#bib.bib4)]. More recently[[5](#bib.bib5)],
    sparse regularization has been jointly integrated with implicit regularization
    provided by denoising algorithms by using the plug and play priors and consensus
    equilibrium framework [[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8)]. The versatility
    of deep learning has also been explored to solve the shot interpolation problem
    in a supervised fashion [[9](#bib.bib9)], specifically with a residual network
    architecture trained on data samples generated with bicubic interpolation of the
    incomplete data set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A key aspect of supervised deep learning approaches for seismic data interpolation
    is that they employ external data sets. For instance, a number of authors [[10](#bib.bib10),
    [11](#bib.bib11), [12](#bib.bib12), [13](#bib.bib13), [14](#bib.bib14)] employ
    convolutional neural networks (CNN) following an end-to-end training strategy
    that requires large training data sets. Alternatively, deep internal learning
    approaches that exploit the structural redundancy of the field data itself, rather
    than employing vast training data sets, have been proposed for seismic trace interpolation
    [[15](#bib.bib15), [16](#bib.bib16)], using deep image priors (DIP) [[17](#bib.bib17),
    [18](#bib.bib18)] and recurrent neural networks (RNN) [[19](#bib.bib19)]. Further,
    a combination of internal and external learning for trace interpolation has been
    studied[[20](#bib.bib20)]. Although all these works have explored deep learning-based
    solutions for irregular sub-sampling schemes [[21](#bib.bib21), [22](#bib.bib22)],
    they implicitly require a binning process to rearrange irregularly sampled seismic
    data onto a regular grid with missing entries (traces).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, this work presents a deep internal learning approach to estimate
    complete missing shot gathers in an irregular land survey bypassing the binning
    step. The proposed method takes advantage of a recent branch of work in computer
    graphics, coordinate-based neural representations, which allows the encoding of
    a continuous spatial field into the weights of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) by
    mapping coordinates to pixel values, in an unsupervised manner [[23](#bib.bib23),
    [24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25)]. Specifically, the proposed coordinate-based
    seismic interpolation (CoBSI) method learns a continuous mapping from the spatial
    and temporal coordinates of the (incomplete) acquired seismic data to the underlying
    recorded field. The continuous nature of the neural representation can model irregular
    sampling scenarios without a binning process and is not constrained to have a
    spatial resolution, reducing memory costs compared with discrete representations.
    Furthermore, in contrast to current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach
    enables seismic shot interpolation for both regular and irregular 3D land surveys,
    in an unsupervised fashion, i.e., without additional training data. The proposed
    approach is validated using 3D seismic data from orthogonal grids such as cross-spreads,
    focusing specially on randomly subsampled regular and irregular grids with acoustic
    synthetic data, Stratton survey [[26](#bib.bib26)] and SEAM Phase II Foothills
    model [[27](#bib.bib27)]. The results show that CoBSI outperforms the multichannel
    singular spectrum analysis (MSSA), damped-MSAA (DMSSA), sequential generalized
    K-means (SGK), and sparsity-based shot reconstruction methods.

- en: Coordinate-based neural representations have been successfully applied to unsupervised
    generation of highly realistic views of scenes with complicated geometries and
    appearance [[25](#bib.bib25), [28](#bib.bib28)], and implicit neural representations
    of signals for solving boundary value problems [[24](#bib.bib24)]. In the same
    line of work, the coordinate-based internal learning (CoIL) approach in [[23](#bib.bib23)]
    extrapolated these ideas to solve imaging inverse problems by modeling a continuous
    measurement field from a subsampled and noisy set of measurements, using geometry
    parameters of a tomographic imaging system. Since a seismic acquisition can be
    described in terms of a coordinate system, resembling the continuous field modeling
    from the computer vision area, this work explores a coordinate-based modeling
    to address the seismic shot interpolation problem in a deep internal learning
    approach. It is worth pointing out that CoBSI addresses a substantially more complex
    interpolation than that in [[23](#bib.bib23)], since the seismic wavefield we
    want to interpolate contains different responses from reflected, refracted, and
    surface waves.

    a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The positional encoding maps help to preserve high-frequency
    information through the encoding of coordinate positions [[29](#bib.bib29)], while
    the MLP works as an interpolator from the encoded coordinates to the signal amplitude.
    For instance, [[28](#bib.bib28)] shows that passing input points through a simple
    Fourier feature mapping enables a MLP to learn high-frequency functions in low-dimensional
    problem domains. It is worth noting that the seismic interpolation task with MLP
    relies on a low-dimensional problem as explained below.

    a binning pre-processing step to cast the irregularly sampled data into a regular
    grid. The main drawback of these approaches is that the interpolator assumes linear
    continuity, since it is applied only in the shots direction, which in 3D acquisitions
    does not allow interpolation of the two-dimensional wavefield. For this reason,
    the approach in [[4](#bib.bib4)] is limited to 2D shots in split-spread geometries.

    despite the simplicity of the neural network, as it has been previously shown
    for other computational imaging problems [[25](#bib.bib25), [34](#bib.bib34)].
    Further, it should be noted that the CoBSI formulation is flexible, so that other,
    more complex neural network architectures can be employed instead of the MLP,
    at the expense of their inherent computational complexity. One of the main advantages
    of CoBSI is that once the seismic neural representation is obtained from the available
    incomplete data, it is possible to estimate the response of the continuous field
    at any arbitrary coordinate within the analysis domain, so that complete missing
    shot gathers can be accurately estimated. In addition, compared to other interpolation
    or reconstruction methods where parameter tuning must be done, in CoBSI the number
    of frequencies in the mapping function is closely related to the dimensionality
    of the seismic data. Therefore, the hyperparameters $M,N,K$ from Equation ([4](#S4.E4
    "In IV-A Anisotropic Positional Encoding ‣ IV Coordinate-based Seismic Shot Interpolation

    variation will be mainly focused in the receiver direction (in-line), because
    more spatial information exists. On the other hand, dealing with inline-offset

    presents the number of trainable parameters (NTP) of convolutional neural networks
    such as U-Net [[22](#bib.bib22), [46](#bib.bib46)] and autoencoders [[47](#bib.bib47),
    [48](#bib.bib48), [49](#bib.bib49)] under supervised learning schemes, as well
    as an ordinary convolutional neural network CNN [[35](#bib.bib35)]. It is worth
    noting that these methods focus on interpolating receivers in 2D and 3D seismic
    data. In contrast, CoBSI aims to estimate complete missing shots, which is substantially
    a more complex task. Further, it is able to obtain such interpolations employing
    a simpler network (MLP), entailing less computational resources in an unsupervised
    strategy, as only the weights and bias of the MLP are learned. While [[35](#bib.bib35)]
    is an unsupervised learning approach, it only considers missing trace reconstruction
    for uniform subsampling, which is unrealistic for field applications.'

- en: 'A coordinate-based seismic interpolation (CoBSI) method to estimate missing
    seismic shots in both regular and irregular 3D land seismic acquisitions has been
    proposed. Unlike state-of-the-art reconstruction methods that employ index-based
    models, CoBSI employs a coordinate-based approach that allows data interpolation
    in irregular geometries. Further, a key component of CoBSI is an anisotropic positional
    encoding layer in the neural network to map from low to high dimension coordinates
    to consider the variation in the reference axes corresponding to time, receivers
    and shots domains. Experimental results showed the ability of the proposed method
    on three different scenarios: (i) irregular geometry and synthetic wavefield,
    (ii) geometry with a gap in real acquisition from Texas, and (iii) the well-known
    geophysical SEAM Phase II Foothills model with regular acquisition. The obtained
    results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method with respect to sparsity-based
    and low-rank interpolation, since CoBSI can estimate continuous seismic events
    while providing a smooth signal in the space-time domains. Quantitatively, in
    average CoBSI outperformed the competing methods by up to 22.11 dB of PSNR in
    synthetic data and 6.4 dB and 7.31 dB for the real-data experiments.'
