- en: We constructed a far ultraviolet (FUV) all sky map based on observations from
    the Far Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (FIMS) aboard the Korean microsatellite
    STSAT-1\. For the $\sim$20$\%$ of the sky not covered by FIMS observations, predictions
    from a deep artificial neural network were used. Seven datasets were chosen for
    input parameters, including five all sky maps of H$\alpha$, E(B-V), N(HI), and
    two X-ray bands, with Galactic longitudes and latitudes. 70$\%$ of the pixels
    of the observed FIMS dataset were randomly selected for training as target parameters
    and the remaining 30$\%$ were used for validation. A simple four-layer neural
    network architecture, which consisted of three convolution layers and a dense
    layer at the end, was adopted, with an individual activation function for each
    convolution layer; each convolution layer was followed by a dropout layer. The
    predicted FUV intensities exhibited good agreement with Galaxy Evolution Explorer
    (GALEX) observations made in a similar FUV wavelength band for high Galactic latitudes.
    As a sample application of the constructed map, a dust scattering simulation was
    conducted with model optical parameters and a Galactic dust model for a region
    that included observed and predicted pixels. Overall, FUV intensities in the observed
    and predicted regions were reproduced well.

- en: Observations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the far ultraviolet (FUV) wavelengths
    (900–1750Å) are extremely useful as they provide important information on the
    physical and chemical processes that occur among the constituents of our galaxy.
    For example, emission lines of highly ionized atoms provide clues on how Galactic
    hot gas is generated and cooled due to interaction with the ambient environment
    (Jo et al., [2019](#bib.bib32)). The FUV band also contains many molecular hydrogen
    fluorescence lines, which are good tracers of star-forming regions in molecular
    clouds (Jo et al., [2017](#bib.bib31)). Furthermore, because the diffuse continuum
    background is believed to be the starlight scattered by interstellar dust, its
    observation helps us understand scattering properties of the dust grains and geometries
    of molecular clouds, particularly when using scattering simulations of stellar
    photons (Jo et al., [2012](#bib.bib29); Lim, Min & Seon, [2013](#bib.bib40); Choi
    et al., [2013](#bib.bib11); Chollet et al., [2015](#bib.bib13)). FUV continuum
    intensity has also exhibited good correlation with H$\alpha$ intensity, indicating
    that the two emissions may have common origins and similar radiative transfer
    mechanisms (Seon et al., [2011a](#bib.bib60), [b](#bib.bib61)).

    to significant extinction effects at FUV wavelengths. There have been only two
    notable FUV survey missions since the one in 1972 by the TD1 satellite (Boksenberg
    et al., [1973](#bib.bib6)). GALEX, launched on 2003 April 28, observed the sky
    in two wavelength bands using a dichroic mirror: FUV (1350–1750 Å) and near-ultraviolet
    (NUV: 1750–2850 Å). Its spatial resolution was 5-7$\arcsec$ in the sky over a
    1°.25 field (Martin et al., [2003](#bib.bib42); Morrissey et al., [2007](#bib.bib44)).
    The GALEX survey data have been used extensively, especially in regard to the
    diffuse UV background (Murthy, Henry & Sujatha, [2010](#bib.bib45); Murthy, [2014a](#bib.bib46),
    [b](#bib.bib47), [2016](#bib.bib48); Henry, [2012](#bib.bib26); Henry et al.,
    [2015](#bib.bib27); Jyothy et al., [2015](#bib.bib33); Narayan, Murthy & Karuppath,
    [2017](#bib.bib49); Akshaya et al., [2018](#bib.bib1), [2019](#bib.bib2)). Though
    not used frequently, low-resolution spectroscopic data are also available from
    observations made with an objective grism. Another FUV mission used a Far-ultraviolet
    IMaging Spectrograph (FIMS), also known as Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from
    Astrophysical Radiation (SPEAR), onboard the spacecraft Science and Technology
    SATellite-1 (STSAT-1) launched on 2003 September 27 (Edelstein et al., [2006a](#bib.bib18),
    [b](#bib.bib19)). FIMS was a dual-band imaging spectrograph with a short- (S-band:
    900–1150 Å with 1.5 Å resolution, 4°$\times$5$\arcmin$ field of view) and long-wavelength
    band (L-band: 1335–1750 Å with 2.5 Å resolution, 8°$\times$5$\arcmin$ field of
    view).Both bands have an imaging resolution of 5′. GALEX and the FIMS L-band possessed
    nearly identical spectral bands. Nevertheless, both GALEX and FIMS did not cover
    the whole sky; GALEX intentionally avoided the observation of bright regions to
    protect the detector whereas the electrical power problems with STSAT-1 caused
    frequent interruption and the early termination of FIMS.'

- en: A deep artificial neural network (DNN) is a subset of machine learning (ML),
    composed of multiple interconnected layers of “artificial neurons” with powerful
    optimization algorithms (LeCun, Bengio & Hinton, [2015](#bib.bib37)). DNN, based
    on automatic learning from massive data during the training stage, can capture
    complex non-linear relationships in data by constructing hierarchical internal
    representations. DNN is especially successful in image processing; specifically,
    the convolutional neural network (CNN) adopts a feed-forward neural network inspired
    by studies of visual recognition mechanisms in mammals (Rawat & Wang, [2017](#bib.bib57)).
    CNN generally utilizes a multi-layer architecture consisting of multiple feature-extraction
    steps such as convolution, pooling, and nonlinear activation layers. While CNN,
    which utilizes only current inputs, is primarily suitable for image processing,
    sequential datasets (in which the next step depends on the previous input data)
    can be modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN algorithm includes
    a hidden state memory that summarizes the previous input information. RNN has
    proven to be particularly successful in natural language processing (Lipton, Berkowitz
    & Elkan, [2015](#bib.bib41)).

    datasets are produced from ground and space observations, and very sophisticated
    analysis tools are required to extract meaningful information (Ball & Brunner,
    [2010](#bib.bib3)). For example, CNN was applied to studies of star-galaxy distinction
    (Kim & Brunner, [2017](#bib.bib34)), gravitational lensing (Schaefer et al., [2018](#bib.bib58);
    Davies, Serjeant & Bromley, [2019](#bib.bib15)), and photometric redshifts (Pasquet
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib55)). Naul et al. ([2018](#bib.bib51)) presented an unsupervised
    auto encoding RNN that could reconstruct noisy, irregularly sampled astronomical
    data. An ML technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) used an optimal hyperplane
    in an N-dimensional space to separate classes (Kovács & Szapudi, [2015](#bib.bib35);
    Pashchenko, Sokolovsky & Gavras, [2018](#bib.bib54)). Baron ([2019](#bib.bib4))
    developed an outlier detection algorithm based on unsupervised learning that could
    identify unexpected new objects in image, spectral, and time-series datasets.

    Galactic plane and bright stars were not observed by GALEX, while several hollow
    areas corresponding to the orbits with a power problem exist in the FIMS dataset.
    Our objective in this study is to fill the unsurveyed regions of the FIMS map
    for the total FUV intensity of the FIMS L-band, using all sky surveys completed
    at other wavelengths and a deep learning algorithm. We use the FIMS dataset for
    this supervised learning because the high-intensity Galactic plane is missing
    in the GALEX dataset, while FIMS covers both low and high-intensity regions. As
    it is difficult to confirm the validity of the predicted FUV intensities of the
    unsurveyed regions due to lack of observations in the corresponding wavelengths,
    we do not intend to furnish a precise map, but rather present a reasonable map
    of a global scale constructed with the assistance of recently-developed neural
    network techniques. Nevertheless, indirect validation is possible by comparing
    the map with simulations of dust scattering in FUV which have often been used
    to model the interstellar dust, as well as with the H$\alpha$ map which is similar
    to the diffuse FUV map after extinction correction in both wavelengths. Another
    objective of our study is to demonstrate the utility of machine learning in astrophysics:
    The present work shows that a very simple deep learning algorithm produces remarkable
    results from unbiased databases even without imposing any a priori assumptions
    based on experience. The present paper is organized as follows: Section [2](#S2
    "2 Construction of FUV the all sky map ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all
    sky map from an incomplete survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm")
    delineates the construction of the FUV all sky map from the incomplete FIMS data.
    We first outline the structure of the FIMS data, followed by the detailed description
    of the DNN algorithm. The resulting map is presented and compared with GALEX observations.
    In Section [3](#S3 "3 Discussion: Dust scattering simulation ‣ Construction of
    a far ultraviolet all sky map from an incomplete survey: Application of a deep
    learning algorithm"), we apply dust scattering simulations to verify the validity
    of the predicted FUV intensities. We conclude the paper with a summary in Section
    [4](#S4 "4 Summary ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all sky map from an incomplete
    survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm").'

    from these two bands are quite different from each other; the R2 band shows a
    striking negative correlation with the neutral ISM while the R5 band has an overall
    positive correlation. We did not attempt to give weights to particular wavelengths
    as such a biased action reflects our prejudice regarding the detailed emission
    and extinction physics that depends on wavelengths and varies from region to region,
    which we are not certain about. We rather left the deep learning algorithm to
    find out the nonlinear relationships between the FUV intensities and those of
    other wavelengths. The acquired nonlinear relationship in the learning stage is
    verified at the validation stage, in which the predicted results are compared
    with the observed data which were not used in the learning stage. All maps, although
    they may have high signal-to-noise ratios at higher resolution, were binned to
    match the resolution of FIMS because the deep learning algorithm requires the

    while the remaining 30% were used for validation. As each dataset has its own
    scales that differ from each other by several orders of magnitude, before applying
    the DNN algorithm we adjusted the dataset ranges by taking logarithmic values
    and normalizing them such that all final datasets have a zero mean with a standard
    deviation of 1\. This normalization process is necessary because the difference
    in intensity among the observed datasets is enormous in the present work, by a
    factor of up to 10^(21). Unscaled input variables may lead to slow or unstable
    learning, often causing the learning process to fail (Sola & Sevilla, [1997](#bib.bib66)).
    Therefore, it is a general practice to normalize the input data to have the same
    dispersions to guarantee convergence. Furthermore, the log-scale normalization
    process also accords well with the log-normal property found in the ISM density
    distribution (Ostriker, Stone & Gammie, [2001](#bib.bib53); Seon, [2012](#bib.bib62);
    Burkhart et al., [2015](#bib.bib8)). The predicted FUV intensities were finally
    obtained by applying the inverse of the normalization process .

    with the combined map, although the simulation map is smoother in part due to
    lower resolution of the 3D dust map. Furthermore, the overall intensity variation
    is larger in the model map than in the combined map, possibly because the model
    dust map has extinction densities lower than their actual values and no high enough
    spatial resolution to represent the complex density variation of dust clouds.
    In fact, the extinction density up to 100 pc from the Sun is much smaller in the
    3D dust map of Leike & Enßlin ([2019](#bib.bib39)) than in other maps, which lowers
    the dust-scattered intensity. It is also known that a clumpy medium has a lower
    effective optical-depth compared to a homogeneous medium with the same dust mass

    light in low-intensity regions (e.g., Seon & Witt, [2013](#bib.bib63); Seon &

    and predicted intensities for the whole sky map. The all sky maps of H$\alpha$,
    E(B-V), N(HI), and two X-ray bands, together with Galactic longitudes and latitudes,
    were employed as input parameters while the incomplete FUV intensity map made
    by FIMS was a target parameter. Even with a simple four-layer neural network architecture
    that consisted of three convolution layers and a final dense layer, results were
    remarkably consistent with other observations. To test the validity and usefulness
    of the predicted intensities further, a small region of the combined map, including
    both the observed and the predicted regions, was compared to the dust scattering
    simulation model that utilized recent 3-D Galactic dust maps and star catalogs

    "Figure 3 ‣ 2.1 Datasets ‣ 2 Construction of FUV the all sky map ‣ Construction
    of a far ultraviolet all sky map from an incomplete survey: Application of a deep
    learning algorithm") is reasonable through various tests. However, it should be
    noted that successful prediction depends on a proper choice of input datasets;
    however, they can also be arbitrary. One trivial question in this line is, how
    would a totally irrelevant input dataset affect the result? To answer this question,
    we tested the impact of an unreasonable input dataset with a geoid height map^(11)^(11)11[https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html](https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html),
    which has nothing to do with the present FUV study. We took the geoid height map,
    shown in Fig. [12](#A1.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ Appendix A Test of the impact of an unreasonable
    input dataset ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all sky map from an incomplete
    survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm")a, as the eighth input dataset
    and ran the same DNN code, along with the seven original datasets. The result
    is shown in Fig. [12](#A1.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ Appendix A Test of the impact of an
    unreasonable input dataset ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all sky map from
    an incomplete survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm")b, which is hardly
    different from the original result in Fig. [3](#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 2.1 Datasets
    ‣ 2 Construction of FUV the all sky map ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all
    sky map from an incomplete survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm").
    We also compared the predicted FUV intensities with the corresponding GALEX observations
    in Fig. [12](#A1.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ Appendix A Test of the impact of an unreasonable
    input dataset ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all sky map from an incomplete
    survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm")c and obtained a result very
    similar to that shown in Fig. [4](#S2.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 2.3 FUV all sky map ‣ 2 Construction
    of FUV the all sky map ‣ Construction of a far ultraviolet all sky map from an
    incomplete survey: Application of a deep learning algorithm"). We believe that
    this test confirms that an irrelevant dataset would not contribute to the final
    result, implying that the input datasets adopted in this study contribute to the
    final predicted FUV map with appropriate weights.'
