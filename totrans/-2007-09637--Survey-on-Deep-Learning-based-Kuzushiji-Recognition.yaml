  zh: I 引言
- en: Kuzushiji has been commonly used in Japan for more than a thousand years. However,
    since the 1900s, schools have no longer been teaching Kuzushiji, and only a few
    thousand people in Japan can currently read and understand it. Hiragana characters¹¹1Hiragana
    is one of the three different character sets used in Japanese writing. Each Hiragana
    character represents a particular syllable. There are 46 basic characters. have
    a root Kanji²²2Kanji is another one of the three character sets used in the Japanese
    language. Along with syllabaries, Kanji is made up of ideographic characters,
    and each letter symbolizes a specific meaning. Most Kanji characters were imported
    from China, although some were developed in Japan. Although there are approximately
    50,000 Kanji characters, only approximately 2,500 are actually used in daily life
    in Japan. called a Jibo³³3A Jibo is a root Kanji character of Hiragana. For example,
    the character “あ” is derived from different Jibos including “安” and “阿.”, leading
    to various shapes for a single character; training is required to read characters
    that differ from modern Hiragana. For this reason, many researchers have been
    working on Kuzushiji recognition using machine learning techniques. Recently,
    with the advent of deep learning, research on Kuzushiji recognition has accelerated
    and the accuracy of the methods has significantly improved. In this paper, we
    present a survey and analysis of recent methods of Kuzushiji recognition based
    on deep learning.

  zh: II 楷书识别的代表性研究
- en: Many studies on Kuzushiji recognition were conducted prior to the introduction
    of deep learning. The “Historical Character Recognition Project” [[1](#bib.bib1)],
    which was initiated in 1999, reported the development of a system to support the
    transcription of ancient documents. In this project, to develop a historical document
    research support system, the authors studied a character database, corpus, character
    segmentation, character recognition, intellectual transcription support system,
    and a digital dictionary. Specifically, they developed a computerized historical
    character dictionary using stroke information [[2](#bib.bib2)] as well as Japanese
    off-line hand-written optical character recognition (OCR) technology, and implemented
    a Kuzushiji recognition system for 67,739 categories by combining on-line and
    off-line recognition methods [[3](#bib.bib3)]. Other methods, such as [[4](#bib.bib4)][[5](#bib.bib5)],
    which is a recognition method using self-organizing maps, and [[6](#bib.bib6)],
    which is a recognition method using a neocognitron, have also been proposed.

- en: Since the introduction of deep learning, further research on Kuzushiji recognition
    has become increasingly active, and various methods have been proposed. During
    the early introductory stage of deep learning, most recognition methods [[7](#bib.bib7)][[8](#bib.bib8)]
    were based on approximately 50 different Hiragana images with recognition rates
    of 75% to 90%. There were also studies in which more than 1,000 characters including
    Hiragana, and Katakana⁴⁴4In the same way as Hiragana, Katakana is one of the three
    different character sets used in Japanese. Katakana is also a phonetic syllabary,
    in which each letter represents the sound of a syllable. There are also 46 basic
    characters. and Kanji, were recognized [[9](#bib.bib9)], along with the results
    of character recognition in documents of the Taiwan Governor’s Office, which dealt
    with more than 3,000 characters [[10](#bib.bib10)]. In these studies, the problems
    of large numbers of classes, an unbalanced number of data between classes, and
    a variation of characters were solved through a data augmentation commonly used
    in deep learning training.

- en: In addition, a network that outputs a three-character string has also been proposed
    as a method for recognizing consecutive characters [[11](#bib.bib11)]. This method
    uses single-character and binary classifiers to distinguish between characters;
    the character strings are then recognized using bidirectional long short-term
    memory (BLSTM). The authors reported that the recognition rate of a single character
    was approximately 92%; however, the recognition rate of three characters was only
    approximately 76%. Similarly, a method for recognizing a string of three consecutive
    characters using a sliding window and BLSTM was proposed [[12](#bib.bib12)]. The
    authors used the tendency in which the maximum output probability of a neural
    network is not particularly high for a misaligned character image but is high
    for an accurately aligned image, and increased the recognition rate to 86% by
    integrating multiple results. In addition, a deep learning method for recognizing
    a series of Kuzushiji phrases using an image from “The Tale of Genji” was proposed
    [[13](#bib.bib13)]. An end-to-end method with an attention mechanism was applied
    to recognize consecutive Kuzushiji characters within phrases. This method can
    recognize phrases written in Hiragana (47 different characters) with 78.92% accuracy,
    and phrases containing both Kanji (63 different characters) and Hiragana with
    59.80% accuracy.

  zh: 此外，已经提出了一种输出三字符字符串的网络作为识别连续字符的方法 [[11](#bib.bib11)]。该方法使用单字符和二进制分类器来区分字符；然后使用双向长短期记忆网络（BLSTM）对字符字符串进行识别。作者报告称，单字符的识别率约为92%；然而，三字符的识别率仅约为76%。类似地，还提出了一种使用滑动窗口和BLSTM来识别连续三字符字符串的方法
    [[12](#bib.bib12)]。作者利用神经网络的最大输出概率在字符图像对齐不准确时不会特别高，但在对齐准确时会很高的趋势，通过整合多个结果将识别率提高到86%。此外，还提出了一种使用《源氏物语》图像来识别一系列古字文短语的深度学习方法
    [[13](#bib.bib13)]。该方法应用了具有注意机制的端到端方法来识别短语中的连续古字文字符。该方法可以以78.92%的准确率识别用平假名（47个不同字符）书写的短语，以及以59.80%的准确率识别同时包含汉字（63个不同字符）和平假名的短语。
- en: In recent years, research on Kuzushiji recognition has become increasingly active
    since the Kuzushiji dataset first became publicly available [[14](#bib.bib14)].
    With the development of this database, a PRMU algorithm contest described in [IV-A](#S4.SS1
    "IV-A PRMU Algorithm Contest ‣ IV Benchmarks ‣ Survey on Deep Learning-based Kuzushiji
    Recognition") and a Kaggle competition introduced in [IV-B](#S4.SS2 "IV-B Kaggle
    Competition ‣ IV Benchmarks ‣ Survey on Deep Learning-based Kuzushiji Recognition")
    were held, and many researchers have started to work on Kuzushiji recognition.
    The preparation, progress, and results of a Kuzushiji recognition competition,
    knowledge obtained from the competition, and the value of utilizing machine learning
    competitions have also been reported [[15](#bib.bib15)][[16](#bib.bib16)]. In
    these reports, the results of the Kuzushiji recognition competition showed that
    existing object detection algorithms such as a Faster R-CNN [[17](#bib.bib17)]
    and cascade R-CNN [[18](#bib.bib18)] are also effective for Kuzushiji detection.
    At the forefront of Kuzushiji recognition, end-to-end approaches for actual transcriptions
    are becoming the mainstream. As a representative method, an end-to-end method,
    KuroNet, was proposed to recognize whole pages of text using the U-Net architecture
    [[19](#bib.bib19)][[20](#bib.bib20)]. The authors demonstrated that KuroNet can
    handle long-range contexts, large vocabularies, and non-standardized character
    layouts by predicting the location and identity of all characters given a page
    of text without any preprocessing. To recognize multiple lines of historical documents,
    a document reading system inspired by human eye movements was proposed, and the
    results of evaluations of the PRMU algorithm contest database described in [IV-A](#S4.SS1
    "IV-A PRMU Algorithm Contest ‣ IV Benchmarks ‣ Survey on Deep Learning-based Kuzushiji
    Recognition") [[21](#bib.bib21)] and the Kaggle competition database described
    in [IV-B](#S4.SS2 "IV-B Kaggle Competition ‣ IV Benchmarks ‣ Survey on Deep Learning-based
    Kuzushiji Recognition") [[22](#bib.bib22)] were reported. In addition, a two-dimensional
    context box proposal network used to detect Kuzushiji in historical documents
    was proposed [[23](#bib.bib23)]. The authors employed VGG16 to extract features
    from an input image and BLSTM [[24](#bib.bib24)] for exploring the vertical and
    horizontal dimensions, and then predicted the bounding boxes from the output of
    the two-dimensional context.

- en: In a study on the practical aspects of transcription, a new type of OCR technology
    was proposed to reduce the labor of a high-load transcription [[25](#bib.bib25)].
    This technology is not a fully automated process but aims to save labor by dividing
    tasks between experts and non-experts and applying an automatic processing. The
    authors stated that a translation can be made quickly and accurately by not aiming
    at a decoding accuracy of 100% using only the OCR of automatic processing, but
    by leaving the characters with a low degree of certainty as a “〓 (geta)” and entrusting
    the evaluation to experts in the following process. A method for automatically
    determining which characters should be held for evaluation using a machine learning
    technique was also proposed [[26](#bib.bib26)][[27](#bib.bib27)]. This method
    can automatically identify difficult-to-recognize characters or characters that
    were not used during training based on the confidence level obtained from the
    neural network.

- en: An interactive system was also been proposed to assist in the transcription
    of digitized Japanese historical woodblock-printed books [[31](#bib.bib31)]. This
    system includes a layout analysis, character segmentation, transcription, and
    the generation of a character image database. The procedures for applying the
    system consist of two major phases. During the first phase, the system automatically
    produces provisional character segmentation data, and users interactively edit
    and transcribe the data into text data for storage in the character image database.
    During the second phase, the system conducts automatic character segmentation
    and transcription using the database generated during the first phase. By repeating
    the first and second phases with a variety of materials, the contents of the character
    image database can be enhanced and the performance of the system in terms of character
    segmentation and transcription will increase.

  zh: 2017年和2019年PRMU算法竞赛⁹⁹9A是由模式识别与媒体理解（PRMU）每年举办的竞赛，旨在振兴研究小组活动。竞赛任务要求识别经典日本书籍图像中指定区域的**草体字**，并输出每个字符的Unicode。在此竞赛中，需要识别总共46种平假名字符，不包括片假名或汉字。2017年的竞赛有三个任务，针对不同的难度级别，即级别1、2和3，取决于矩形中包含的字符数量。参与者需要在级别1中识别单个分段字符，在级别2中识别垂直方向上的三个连续字符，在级别3中识别垂直和水平方向上的三个或更多字符。在2019年的竞赛中，任务是识别与2017年级别2相同的垂直方向上的三个连续字符。
- en: Herein, we introduce the tasks of the 2017 contest and the methods used by the
    best performing teams [[33](#bib.bib33)]. The dataset applied in 2017 was constructed
    from 2,222 scanned pages of 15 historical books provided by CODH. One of the 15
    books was used as the test data because it contained many fragmented and noisy
    patterns, as well as various backgrounds. The dataset for level 1 consisted of
    228,334 single Hiragana images, and test data of 47,950 were selected from the
    dataset. To improve the accuracy, multiple models were trained and a voting-based
    ensemble method was employed to integrate the results of many different models.
    The level 2 dataset consists of 92,813 images of three consecutive characters,
    and a test set of 13,648 images was selected from the dataset. A combined architecture
    of a CNN , BLSTM, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) was employed
    [[34](#bib.bib34)], and a sequence error rate (SER) of 31.60% was achieved. In
    the level 3 dataset, there are 12,583 images from which a test set of 1,340 images
    were selected. The authors employed a combination of vertical line segmentation
    and multiple line concatenation before applying a deep convolutional recurrent
    network. The SER is 82.57%, and there is still a significant need for improvement.

- en: A Kaggle competition called “Opening the door to a thousand years of Japanese
    culture” was held from July 19 to October 14, 2019. Whereas the PRMU algorithm
    competition involved a recognition of single-character images or images containing
    a few characters, the Kaggle competition tackled the more challenging task of
    automatically detecting the position of characters on a page of a classical book
    and correctly recognizing the type of characters. Of the 44 books in the Kuzushiji
    dataset described in [III-A](#S3.SS1 "III-A Kuzushiji Dataset ‣ III Datasets ‣
    Survey on Deep Learning-based Kuzushiji Recognition"), 28 books released before
    the competition were used as training data, and 15 books released after the competition
    were used as the test data^(11)^(11)11One book was eliminated from the competition..
    The F value, which is the harmonic mean of the precision (the percentage of correct
    responses among the characters output by the system) and the recall (the percentage
    of correct responses among the characters in the test data), was used for evaluation.
    For approximately 3 months, many international researchers worked on this competition
    and achieved a practical level of accuracy (F value of greater than 0.9). There
    were two typical methods, namely, a single-stage method that applies detection
    and recognition simultaneously, and a two-stage method that conducts character
    detection and recognition in stages. Most of the top teams adopted the two-stage
    method. The two-stage method applied detectors such as a Faster R-CNN and CenterNet
    [[38](#bib.bib38)] to detect character regions, and models such as ResNet [[39](#bib.bib39)]
    to recognize individual characters. As shown in Table [I](#S4.T1 "TABLE I ‣ IV-B
    Kaggle Competition ‣ IV Benchmarks ‣ Survey on Deep Learning-based Kuzushiji Recognition"),

    have also been used to adapt to the environment of an unknown book (author). Moreover,
    a new character class, called a detection error character class, was added to
    eliminate the detection error at the classification stage. Finally, the gradient

    The team employed several types of data augmentation to increase the number of
    training data, as shown below. First, because color and grayscale images were
    mixed in the training data, they used a random grayscale, which randomly converts
    images into monochrome during training. In addition, the training data were augmented
    using techniques such as combining multiple images by applying mixup [[45](#bib.bib45)]
    and random image cropping and patching (RICAP) [[46](#bib.bib46)], and adding
    some noise to the image by random erasing. Because Furigana^(12)^(12)12Furigana
    is made up of phonetic symbols occasionally written next to difficult or rare
    Kanji to show their pronunciation is not a recognition target, post-processing
    such as the creation of a false positive predictor is used for its removal.

    detection followed by a connectionist text proposal network (CTPN) [[48](#bib.bib48)]
    for line-by-line character recognition. One-line images were resized to 32$\times$800,
    and then fed to a model that recognizes a single line of text. A convolutional
    recurrent neural network (CRNN) model was used for line recognition and had a
    structure with 200 outputs. A six-gram language model was trained using the KenLM
    toolkit [[49](#bib.bib49)], and a beam search was applied to decode the CTC output
    of the model. The positional accuracy of the CTC output was improved using multitask
    learning [[50](#bib.bib50)], which added an attention loss. For the data augmentation
    methods, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, random brightness,
    random contrast, random scale, and random distortion were used. A dropout and
    cutout were applied as the regularization methods. Although many other teams reported

    instead of using a predefined approach. In general, although predefined models
    have been designed to provide local features at a high resolution and a wide field
    of view at a low resolution, it was not necessary to provide a wide field of view
    at a significantly low resolution for the Kuzushiji detection task. The team reported

    which are frequently used in object detection, did not perform well, whereas Faster
    R-CNN and CenterNet were successful. As the reason for this, there is almost no
    overlap of characters in the image, which differs from conventional object detection.
    Some teams reported an improved accuracy using the latest models with strong backbones,
    whereas others reported that their own methods were more successful.

    YOLO [[53](#bib.bib53)] 这样在物体检测中常用的模型表现不佳，而 Faster R-CNN 和 CenterNet 则取得了成功。其原因在于图像中的字符几乎没有重叠，这与传统的物体检测不同。一些团队报告说使用最新的强大骨干的模型提高了准确性，而其他团队则报告说他们自己的方法更成功。

- en: In Japan, historical materials have been preserved for more than a thousand
    years; pre-modern books and historical documents and records have been estimated
    to number approximately three million and one billion, respectively. However,
    most historical materials have not been transcribed. Currently, because the Kuzushiji
    database provided by CODH is mainly limited to documents after the Edo period,
    it is difficult to automatically transcribe books written prior to this period.
    To address this issue, it will be necessary to combine multiple books of various
    periods owned by multiple institutions and rebuild a large-scale Kuzushiji database.
    Looking back further into history, the rules for Kuzushiji increase, and thus
    it is expected that there will be many character types and character forms that
    cannot be found in the database. Therefore, we need a framework for handling unknown
    character types and character forms that do not exist in the training data. In
    addition, as one of the problems in character classification, the number of data
    for each character class is imbalanced, and it is impossible to accurately recognize
    characters in a class with an extremely small number of data.
  id: totrans-89

- en: In addition, the quality of the images differs significantly from one book to
    the next, and the writing styles are completely different depending on the author,
    which also makes character recognition difficult to achieve. To this end, it is
    important to increase the number and variation of training data, to incorporate
    techniques such as domain adaptation, and improve the database itself.

- en: There is room for further studies on not only individual character-by-character
    recognition, but also word/phrase/sentence-level recognition based on the surrounding
    characters and context. In the Kaggle competition, although many teams added contextual
    information, such as the use of language models, the accuracy did not significantly
    improve because there are problems specific to Kuzushiji that differ from those
    of modern languages. Therefore, we believe it will be necessary to not only improve
    machine learning techniques such as deep learning, but also learn rules based
    on specialized knowledge regarding Kuzushiji.

- en: Based on the current state of transcription, it is important to design an interface
    that not only allows a complete and automatic recognition of characters, but also

  zh: VII 结论
- en: In this paper, we introduced recent techniques and problems in Kuzushiji recognition
    using deep learning. The introduction of deep learning has dramatically improved
    the detection and recognition rate of Kuzushiji. In particular, the inclusion
    of Kuzushiji recognition in the PRMU algorithm contest and Kaggle competition
    has attracted the attention of numerous researchers, who have contributed to significant
    improvements in accuracy. However, there are still many old manuscripts that need
    to be transcribed, and there are still many issues to be addressed. To solve these
    problems, in addition to improving algorithms such as machine learning, it is
    necessary to further promote the development of a Kuzushiji database and cooperation
    among individuals in different fields.
