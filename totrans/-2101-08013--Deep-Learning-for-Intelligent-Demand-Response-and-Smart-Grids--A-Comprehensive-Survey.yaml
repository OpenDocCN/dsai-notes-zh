- en: Electricity is one of the mandatory commodities for mankind today. To address
    challenges and issues in the transmission of electricity through the traditional
    grid, the concepts of smart grids and demand response have been developed. In
    such systems, a large amount of data is generated daily from various sources such
    as power generation (e.g., wind turbines), transmission and distribution (microgrids
    and fault detectors), load management (smart meters and smart electric appliances).
    Thanks to recent advancements in big data and computing technologies, Deep Learning
    (DL) can be leveraged to learn the patterns from the generated data and predict
    the demand for electricity and peak hours. Motivated by the advantages of deep
    learning in smart grids, this paper sets to provide a comprehensive survey on
    the application of DL for intelligent smart grids and demand response. Firstly,
    we present the fundamental of DL, smart grids, demand response, and the motivation
    behind the use of DL. Secondly, we review the state-of-the-art applications of
    DL in smart grids and demand response, including electric load forecasting, state
    estimation, energy theft detection, energy sharing and trading. Furthermore, we
    illustrate the practicality of DL via various use cases and projects. Finally,
    we highlight the challenges presented in existing research works and highlight
    important issues and potential directions in the use of DL for smart grids and
    demand response.

    for future supply. It has to be dispersed to the consumers immediately as it is
    produced. The electric grid, in short, grid, is a network of electricity generating
    stations, transmission lines that carry the electricity to the customers. With
    the rapid growth of population and increased number of industries, it has become
    a difficult task for the grids to manage the demand of the electricity for household
    purposes and industrial purposes. The increased demand of electricity at particular
    hours of the day lead to several problems like short circuits, failure of transformers.
    To address these issues of transmission of electricity through traditional grids,
    there is a necessity to predict the consumption patterns of the customers to effectively
    deliver the electricity. In this context, the concept of smart grids (SG) has
    been introduced. A SG can intelligently predict the demands of electricity and
    hence can transmit the electricity based on the predicted demand. A SG through
    its intelligent sensing and prediction can address several issues of the traditional
    grids such as demand forecasting, reduction of power consumption, reducing the
    risks of short circuits thereby saving the loss of lives and properties [[1](#bib.bib1),
    [2](#bib.bib2), [3](#bib.bib3)]. The advancements in technologies such as the
    Internet of Things (IoT) [[4](#bib.bib4)], fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks
    and beyond [[5](#bib.bib5)], big data analytics [[6](#bib.bib6)] and machine learning
    (ML), have realized the true potential of SGs [[7](#bib.bib7)]. SG has several
    stakeholders and it can be connected with several other smart areas such as smart
    vehicles, smart buildings, smart power plants, smart city, etc. as depicted in
    Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Deep Learning for Intelligent Demand
    Response and Smart Grids: A Comprehensive Survey").'

- en: Demand response (DR), one of the most important concepts in SG, encourages the
    customers to offload non-essential consumption of electricity during the peak
    hours of the day. DR can effectively manage the supply of electricity in a balanced
    way during peak hours. By integrating the recent technologies such as ML, IoT
    and big data analytics with SG, the electricity demand of the customers can be
    predicted and the DR can be automated [[8](#bib.bib8), [9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)].
    As the amount of data generated from the SG network is vast, deep learning (DL)
    based models can be used to learn the patterns from the data and predict the demand
    of electricity and peak hours. In the literature, several researchers have investigated
    the DL concepts for DR in SG. Wen *et al.* [[11](#bib.bib11)] used a DL model
    based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) to identify the uncertainties in the
    SG networks, optimal rates of electricity for each hour, power load. Hong *et
    al.* [[12](#bib.bib12)] presented a load forecasting mechanism for residential
    purposes through DL. Wen *et al.* [[13](#bib.bib13)] proposed a DL based model
    to predict hourly load demand of electricity for residential buildings in Austin,
    Texas, USA. Hafeez *et al.* [[14](#bib.bib14)] proposed a factored conditional
    restricted Boltzmann machine model based on DL to predict hourly electricity load.
    Ruan *et al.* [[15](#bib.bib15)] proposed a neural-network-based lagrange multiplier
    selection model to optimize the number of iterations in neural networks for predicting
    DR in SG. Wang *et al.* [[16](#bib.bib16)] proposed a DRL method integrated with
    duelling deep Q network to optimize the DR management in SG. Zhang *et al.* [[17](#bib.bib17)]
    proposed edge-cloud integrated solution for DR in SG using reinforcement learning.

    DL for addressing security issues, load and price forecasting, energy harvesting,
    smart metering in SG [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20), [21](#bib.bib21),
    [22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23), [24](#bib.bib24), [25](#bib.bib25), [26](#bib.bib26)].
    For example, the reviews on cybersecurity (e.g., false data injection attacks
    and denial-of-service attacks) in SG systems can be found in [[18](#bib.bib18),
    [19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20), [21](#bib.bib21), [22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23)].
    Mollah *et al.* [[24](#bib.bib24)] discussed the use of blockchain in addressing
    various security issues that are caused by the growing number of connections in
    the centralized SG systems. Hu *et al.* [[25](#bib.bib25)] presented a contemporary
    review on various aspects of SG-wireless powered communication (WPC) systems,
    including utilization, redistribution, trading, and planning of the harvested
    energy. This work also revealed the application of mathematical tools (e.g., convex
    and Lyapunov optimization) in optimizing SG-WPC systems along with potential directions
    in beyond 5G systems. We can observe that a comprehensive review on the use of
    DL for DR in SG is still missing as the existing surveys focused on particular
    topics such as security and application. Moreover, DL has been recently/widely
    utilized for intelligent solutions in SG and DR systems, but the recent developments
    may not be included in the existing surveys. Motivated by these observations,
    in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on applications of DL for DR
    and SG systems. The primary motivation of the current review is to educate the
    readers on the state-of-the-art on DL, DR, applications of DL in DR and SG.

    and Motivations ‣ Deep Learning for Intelligent Demand Response and Smart Grids:
    A Comprehensive Survey") depicts the relation of DL with representation learning,
    ML, and artificial intelligence (AI). ML algorithms can learn from data. ML enables
    us to program the problems that are not solvable with traditional programming
    techniques. It allows a computer program to learn from experience, concerning
    a task and evaluates performance measures over the task to improve the learning.
    Several tasks can be programmed with ML, such as classification, regression, transcription,
    sampling, etc. For evaluating the performance of ML algorithms quantitative metrics
    like accuracy and error rate are used. Based on the experience acquired during
    the learning process of the algorithm, ML algorithms can be divided into two broad
    classes on the basis of the learning: supervised and unsupervised. Others are
    reinforcement learning and recommendation systems. Supervised learning algorithms
    learn through a dataset consisting of attributes, whereas each of the evidence
    is also accompanied by a class label or target class. Linear regression is the
    fundamental technique of supervised ML. The main objective of any ML algorithm
    is to deliver good performance over unknown data not only over training data.
    The performance of any ML algorithm can be evaluated by its ability to achieve
    minimum training error and the difference of training error and generalization
    error should be small. Unsupervised learning algorithms use a dataset consisting
    of several attributes, then obtain valuable associations from the dataset, for
    example, clustering algorithms.'

- en: Deep neural network (DNN) is the most effectively used technique in DL. DNNs
    are the extended form of the artificial neural network (ANN) with a significantly
    higher number of layers to acquire a depth of the network. DL algorithms typically
    learn the complete probability distribution through the dataset, explicitly as
    in density approximation, or implicitly as synthesis or denoising. Most DL algorithms
    are based on stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms [[29](#bib.bib29)].
    Usually, they are a combination of a set of modules, an optimization algorithm,
    a cost function, a model, and a dataset, to build an ML algorithm. Present DL
    facilitates supervised learning by a framework, which includes additional layers
    and more neurons within them, to design a DNN which can implement today’s increasing
    complexity requirements. It can map an input vector to an output vector quickly
    for a given big model and a huge training set. A feed-forward DNN can perform
    this function effectively, but further regularization, optimization, and scaling
    the DNN to handle large input vectors, for example, high-resolution image data
    or heavy length time series data should be specialized. For incorporating these
    requirements convolutional and RNN were designed.

    came into existence. DR is one of the important strategies followed by electricity
    companies for the reduction of energy consumption by the consumers during peak
    hours. In this strategy customers can choose to shed non-essential loads by themselves
    or it can be done automatically by the utility during peak hours of the day [[8](#bib.bib8)].
    DR is an agreement between the customers and the utility based on certain conditions
    like time intervals, price, and load. Through DR, power consumption can be reduced
    during the peak hours of the day that results in reduction of operating costs,
    installation costs, and also the mitigation of potential SG failures. DR leads
    to the lowering the costs of electricity that can lead to overall reduction of
    retail prices. Utility companies can encourage DR by offering lower electricity
    prices during non-peak hours to encourage the customers to shed non-essential
    loads during peak time.

    DRNN-GRU model is a five-layered neural network consisting of optimized hyperparameters

    GRU layer to produce a higher dimension output than the previous layer. This layer
    has tuned more number of weights and bias. The fourth layer is a simple hidden
    layer. The fifth layer is an output layer that produces prediction results. The
    backpropagation is used for parameter optimization, min-max normalization is used
    to scale the train data. Overfitting issues are addressed by adding regularization
    to the cost function and dropout was applied to the hidden layer. The model can

    time and accurate solution for any power system. State variables include voltages,
    angles, etc. Inputs to the state estimators are just these imperfectly defined
    state variables. State estimation suppresses faulty measurements and produces
    the best estimate for any particular power system. The online state-of-health
    estimation shows low accuracy and also affects the accuracy level of state-of-charge
    estimation. In order to overcome one of such low accuracy issues of state variables,
    Song *et al.* [[72](#bib.bib72)] demonstrated a joint lithium-ion battery state
    estimation approach which makes use of data-driven least-square SVM and model-based
    unscented-particle-filter. The direct mapping models involved omit identification
    of parameters and updation in complex operating conditions. This correction of
    state-of-health in state-of-charge estimation gave rise to the joint estimation
    with different time scales. Experiments revealed that the estimated error of maximum
    state-of-charge life cycle is not more than 2% and the state-of-health’s root-mean-square-error
    estimation is not more than 4%. Results of the implemented model by the authors
    showed that both state-of-health and state-of-charge can be evaluated with notable
    accuracy using this demonstrated hybrid estimation procedure. Dynamic state estimation
    is generally used to give real-time and proper management for the operation of

    SG energy systems using DNN algorithm and reinforcement learning. The aim of this
    algorithm is to provide assistance to the service provider to buy energy resources
    from its registered customers in order to stabilize the energy fluctuations and
    improve the authenticity of the grid [[101](#bib.bib101)]. A DNN algorithm is
    used to forecast the undisclosed prices and the demand for energy. Reinforcement
    learning is applied to acquire the best incentive cost for various customers by
    examining the net profit of both customers and service providers. The service
    providers are able to acquire the cost from the electricity market and demand
    for energy from various customers only in the need of the hour because of the
    intrinsic behaviour of the hierarchical electricity market. To solve these kinds
    of future unpredictability, DNN is applied to forecast the undisclosed price and
    demand for energy. The DNN collects new rate and energy demands and predicts the
    future rate and demand for energy. This activity is repeated many times till the
    end of the particular day. Further, along with the predicted future rate and energy
    demands, reinforcement learning is applied to acquire the best incentive rates
    for various customers by analysing the profits of service providers and customers.
    The advantages of application of reinforcement learning have several benefits
    such as model-free, adaptive nature and preciseness. The service provider finds
    the best incentive price by learning from customers directly and it need not require
    any prior expertise or predetermined rule on selection of incentive prices. The
    service providers can obtain the incentive prices independently in an online method
    remodelled to various customers. Further it considers the flexibility’s and uncertainties
    of the energy system. The entire calculation part of the reinforcement algorithm
    is dependent on a mapping table and it is very easy to implement this in several
    real world applications. The results prove that the proposed algorithm instigates
    the participation from the demand side, improves the profit of service providers
    and customers and enhances the reliability of the system by stabilizing the energy
    resources. In future, the incentive based algorithm can be expanded to extensive
    capacity resource market framework including the Grid operators and several service

    areas. In order to improve the efficiency of the electrical power system, DR in
    residential area is essential. The basic task in DR system is forecasting the
    short-term load accurately. Several research work has been done on short term
    forecasting of accumulated load data. But forecasting load for single residential
    users is challenging because of its stochastic and dynamic nature of power consumption
    behaviour of individual users. To address this issue, a framework for STLF for
    residential area was proposed using spatio-temporal correlation in load data and
    by the application of DL algorithms [[12](#bib.bib12)]. STLF helps to forecast
    the demand of the users in the forthcoming future and also provides recommendations
    on DR in residential area. It also fulfils the electricity demand of the users
    and minimizes the danger of outages. The spatio-temporal correlation applied in
    this framework defines the spatio correlation amidst the power consumption practices
    of various kinds of devices and the temporal correlation among the archival power
    consumption practices and future power consumption practices. In this framework,
    the spatio temporal correlation between various kinds of power consumption practices
    were explored to enhance the SLTF’s performance. Several time series analyses
    were conducted in order to define the power consumption practices of various applications
    and also their spatio temporal interrelations. A method using DL algorithm with
    iterative ResBlocks for STLF was proposed to find the correlation between the
    utilization behaviours. The iterative ResBlocks based method was applied to acquire
    knowledge in deep and shallow features of input data. The proposed framework constitutes
    four steps which includes data collection, preprocessing, training and load forecasting.
    The data collection step gathers units from smart meters which provides information
    about power consumption of various devices for each customer. Data preprocessing
    step performs data cleaning, integration and transformation in order to enhance
    the data quality of STLF framework. Training step applies a DL algorithm with
    an iterative ResBlock method to find the spatio-temporal correlation between various
    power consumption practices. Finally after performing preprocessing and training

    and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in multi-zone official buildings. HVAC loads
    constitute nearly 30% of the power consumed by an official building. Several steps
    have been taken by distribution system operators for DR projects to manage the
    electricity input of HVAC systems indirectly and directly using electricity rate
    variations and communication links respectively. Many studies have been done on
    DR for HVAC systems. The developed models consist of several factors to be gathered
    from parameter estimation methods and it is a time consuming process. To overcome
    the problem of time consuming models and parameter tuning, ML algorithms have
    been used in DR for HVAC systems. A new approach for optimal DR of HVAC systems
    in a multi zone commercial building was proposed using supervised learning methods
    [[102](#bib.bib102)]. The data obtained from normal building operating circumstances
    were applied to train ANN. The ANN with time delayed input data, feedback loops,
    various activation functions and several hidden layers was applied to find the
    variation in temperature in each zone when there is change in the power supply
    of the HVAC system. In the supervised learning algorithms, the ANNs are modelled
    and trained using the past data gathered. The ANN methods are iterated using linear
    equations and combined to form an optimization problem for rate based DR systems.
    The issue is resolved for several building thermal situations and electricity
    rates. The obtained solutions are applied to train a DNN model in order to find
    the optimal DR method namely supervised learning aided meta prediction (SLAMP).
    The SLAMP method schedules the input power of the HVAC system directly for building
    thermal conditions and electricity rates for the next 24 hours. This helps to
    reduce the time for computation and provides a curve for rate and optimal demand
    helping the distribution system operator to optimize the load for HVAC through

    categorized into incentive based and price based models. Price based DR models
    refers to the user behaviour with respect to the modification in electricity consumption
    rates. Incentive based DR models represent the behaviour in order to acquire profitable
    incentives. The important task of incentive DR is interruptible user load in peak
    load situations or in case of emergencies to achieve a fast response and enhanced
    demand side strength. Model based optimization methods associated with IL needs
    physical and mathematical model explicitly and it leads to difficulty in adapting
    to practical operating circumstances. Therefore a model free method based on DRL
    was designed with a DDQN in order to optimize the management of DR of IL for time
    of use tariff and changing power utilization patterns [[16](#bib.bib16)]. An architecture
    for DDQN based automatic DR was constructed initially to provide a solution for
    practical applications of DR. The problem of management of DR in IL is described
    as a Markov decision process to acquire utmost long term profit. The DDQN based
    DRL algorithm helps to solve the problem of Markov decision process with utmost
    progressive reward. The actual grid state is directly mapped to the DR management
    policy in the proposed DDQN based DRL algorithm and attains the aim of regulation

    where the service provider will act as an intermediary (brokerage) between the

    utility company to the consumer. Though the service provider uses dynamic pricing
    to manage microgrids, the uncertainties in microgrids and inaccurate customer
    details (consumer load demand level, customer purchase pattern and usage patterns),
    makes it more challenging to determine the pricing based on consumer’s future
    behaviour. On the other hand, consumers face the problem of energy consumption
    scheduling incurred through uncertainties in electricity price and their usage.
    RL based multi-agent model was proposed in [[103](#bib.bib103)] to learn both
    the consumer’s energy consumption and the service provider’s dynamic pricing based

    flexibility analysis on the demand side: The most challenging task in DR is to

    and transition probability. Furthermore, a minute load forecasting error may cause
    huge economic loss. Therefore an effective load forecasting in SG is challenging
    and should be addressed efficiently. DNN algorithm (namely long short term memory
    architecture) and ANN-based time series models can be used for accurate prediction

    The model also uses a clustering-based pooling method to avoid overfitting and

    as an alternative for the internal combustion engine for electricity transportation.
    EVs are used in a vehicle to grid (V2G) and vehicle to home(V2H) communications
    of smart grid technology. The integration of EVs with the electric grid will increase
    its power quality, efficiency and performance specifically during peak hours.
    Some of the services offered by EVs are peak power shaving (balancing load during
    demand), spinning reserve (increasing power generating capacity), power grid regulations
    and load levelling [[117](#bib.bib117)]. Recharging the EV batteries impose a
    greater challenge in maintaining EVs (because of more number of uncertainties).
    Sometimes charging of EVs will be very frequent and may consume more time. Scheduling
    the charging time for EVs should be highly focused on providing a balanced load
    in all the EVs without collision (simultaneous charging of more EVs at one particular
    time may exhaust the power system). DNN was employed in [[118](#bib.bib118)] to
    make real-time decisions on charging EVs (during the connection) to reduce the
    vehicle power cost based on the historical data on the connections. A decision

    Furthermore, the EV charging load was predicted based on the traffic flow forecast

    is complexity in procuring labels with a high number of parameters. This is because
    of the inconsistencies in operational data. The various components in the SG,
    namely master control units in the power plants connected to the remote terminal
    units will deliver the power energy to the consumers (through intelligent electronic
    devices for secured energy delivery and monitoring). A smart meter, one of the
    significant components of the SG environment, acts as an intermediary between
    the utility grid and the consumer. It has many modules such as timing, communication,
    metering, indicating, encoding, power and control modules. Tampering of data during
    data communication among these modules may lead to inconsistencies in power supply,
    power pricing and loss of sensitive information.

    types of computational methods were employed for electric load prediction, several
    issues like handcrafted features, impotent learning, limited learning capacity
    and inability to handle non-linear data. So ML algorithms were used to solve these
    issues, but those algorithms were not fit for larger data and a small error in
    forecast led to tremendous effects. Moreover, microgrids have a lot of variation
    in electricity load. Therefore, an efficient load forecasting model with the feature
    engineering and optimization technique is required for faster and error-free forecasting.
    A hybrid model integrating DL and heuristic optimization techniques (genetic wind
    driven optimization) was developed in [[14](#bib.bib14)] with better accuracy
    than the existing model. But the model was not evaluated for the real-time data.
    Scheduling of EVs for charging and EVs load forecast must include various parameters
    (historical data and real-time data) for making wise decisions and optimal solutions.
    Therefore, this issue can be resolved by integrating one or more DL techniques
    with optimization algorithms.

    with the help of blockchain. The decentralized blockchain would be an essential
    candidate for handling the energy big data [[124](#bib.bib124)]. The heterogeneous
    data from diversified sources of energy big data can be stored in the blocks,
    and the blockchain capability of representing any of the data in a unique format
    will make the data structured and predictable. They were, therefore reducing the
    complexity of big data processing systems. Also, blockchain through smart contracts
    provides secured and privacy-preserving data transactions. A lightweight blockchain
    framework can be deployed for SG with DL, thereby segregating the metadata by
    maintaining a side chain for enhancing security and privacy in the energy transactions.
    Besides, the double-spending attacks concerned with blockchain framework can be
    alleviated by strengthening the blockchain security. Blockchain usage is still
    limited as the mining process in blockchain consumes more resources. So, the edge
    computing, which brings computation closer to the data source by offloading the
    mining activities, can be integrated with blockchain for low-latency response
    in energy transactions [[125](#bib.bib125)]. Henceforth, integration of big data
    analytics (for volume and veracity of data), blockchain (for integrity and privacy-preserving
    transaction) and edge computing (faster energy transactions) in smart grid technology,
    will ensure secured and sustainable energy management services.

    reduce delays in performing predictions on load forecasting, energy pricing and
    demand-side response management. Edge AI, intelligence at the edge helps in making
    real-time perceptions based on the data generated from the edge devices (like
    smart meter) using AI algorithms processed at the SG edge devices. For instance,
    the customer usage pattern can be predicted based on the data accumulated at smart
    meters [[126](#bib.bib126)]. Furthermore, edge AI can be utilized for effective
    power resource optimization in a distributed manner, load forecasting, fault identification
    and diagnosis at appliances level (the edge devices). This, in turn, will be an
    added advantage for the future grid, which dramatically reduces the peak demand,
    saves enormous energy with increased revenue and effective customer service. As
    discussed in challenges, DL models on cloud platform play a vital role in combatting
    security issues in SG as well as in blockchain-based energy network. Though DL
    models serve its best, offering varied services at smart grid can be further improved
    with edge AI. Through the integration of edge AI with DL enabled SG network, huge
    delays in complex computation and task offloading can be alleviated by moving
    the computation at edge devices. Furthermore, distributing intelligence computation
    at the edge devices with identity authentication will secure and strengthen the
    SG. The distributed intelligence, together with anomaly detection (via identity
    authentication before processing) at the edge, will combat the cybersecurity issues.

    which allows the quantum computer to explore simultaneously diverse solutions
    to a given optimization problem before disintegrating to an optimum solution.
    Also, through quantum entanglement property of QC, the different qubits can sense
    what happens to other qubits without passing any signalling messages. However,
    DL models provide various insights for energy optimization from hybrid power systems
    in the energy industry. These models must consider multiple data from heterogeneous
    sources to find an economical combination that can combat energy demands with
    an acceptable level of security.QC is an appropriate technology for smart grid
    energy optimization from distributed and heterogeneous sources. As the number
    of IoT devices and energy generators increases the security risks in various smart
    grid management activities such as attacks during data accumulations from varied
    sources and energy transactions during bidirectional trading. The quantum cryptography
    can be employed to secure SG from these attacks. A lightweight quantum encryption

    DL is larger resource consumption (network bandwidth) for processing the energy
    data accumulations and EVs management during energy trading. Upon integration
    of ultra-reliable, 5G with SG enabled DL can fasten the data processing and can
    improve the performance of the DL models with better accuracy. The integration
    of 5G with smart grid technology enhances the availability (DR management), fault
    tolerance, cybersecurity and self-healing capability of the grid. Furthermore,
    it assists effective and faster V2G communications in the smart grid environment
    through EVs [[128](#bib.bib128)]. Although 5G offers indisputable benefit to smart
    grid, it may lead smart grid vulnerable to more cyber attacks, incompatibility
    of older devices will require replacement, more device dependency and overcrowding
    risk at frequency spectrum. To overcome these limitations, sixth-generation (6G)
