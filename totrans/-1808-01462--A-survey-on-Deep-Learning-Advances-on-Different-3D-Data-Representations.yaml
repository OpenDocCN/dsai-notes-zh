    rich information about the full geometry of sensed objects and scenes. Recently,
    with the availability of both large 3D datasets and computational power, it is
    today possible to consider applying deep learning to learn specific tasks on 3D
    data such as segmentation, recognition and correspondence. Depending on the considered
    3D data representation, different challenges may be foreseen in using existent
    deep learning architectures. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview
    about various 3D data representations highlighting the difference between Euclidean
    and non-Euclidean ones. We also discuss how Deep Learning methods are applied
    on each representation, analyzing the challenges to overcome.'

- en: Despite the effectiveness of volumetric deep learning methods, most of these
    approaches are computationally expensive because of the volumetric nature of the
    convolutional filters to extract the features which increase the computational
    complexity cubically with respect to the voxels resolution which limits the usage
    of 3D volumetric DL models. That is why exploiting multi-views of 3D objects is
    practical. Indeed, it enables exploiting the already established 2D DL paradigms
    without the need to design a tailored model for 3D volumetric data with high computational
    complexity as shown in pipeline illustrated in Fig. LABEL:fig:taxonomy. One of
    the first attempts to exploit 2D DL models for learning multi-view 3D data was
    presented by Leng et at. in (Leng et al., [2014](#bib.bib82)) where DBN was employed
    on various view-based depth images to extract high-level features of the 3D object.
    A later-wise training manner was used to train the DBN using the “Contractive
    Divergence” method. The proposed model produced better results than the composite
    descriptors approach employed in (Daras and Axenopoulos, [2010](#bib.bib36)).
    Xie et al. (Xie et al., [2015](#bib.bib146)) proposed “Multi-View Deep Extreme
    Learning Machine (MVD-ELM)”. The proposed MVD-ELM was employed on 20 multi-view
    depth images that were uniformly captured with a sphere at the centre of the 3D
    object. The proposed MVD-ELM contained Conv layers that had shared weights across
    all the views. The output activation weights were optimized according to the feature
    maps extracted. This work has been extended to be Fully Convolutional, resulting
    in (FC-MVD-ELM). FC-MVD-ELM was trained using the multi-view depth images to be
    tested for 3D segmentation. The predicted labels from the training stage were
    then projected back to the 3D object where the final result was smoothed using
    the graph cut optimization method. Both MVD-ELM and FC-MVD-ELM were tested on
    3D shape classification and segmentation tasks and outperformed the previous work (Wu
    et al., [2015a](#bib.bib143)) and reduced the processing time significantly.

    on multi-view 3D data. Leng et al. in (Leng et al., [2015a](#bib.bib80)) proposed
    an extension of classical AEs in a similar way to the CNN architecture. Their
    proposed framework is called “Stacked Local Convolutional AutoEncoders (SLCAE)”.
    SLCAE operated on multiple multi-view depth images of the 3D object. In SLCAE,
    FC layers were substituted by layers that were connected locally with the use
    of the convolution operation. Multiple AEs ere stacked where the output of the
    last AE was used as a final representation of the 3D object. Experiments on different
    datasets: SHREC’09, NTU and PSB proved the capabilities of this model. As an extension
    to the previous work, Leng et al. proposed a “3D Convolutional Neural Network
    (3DCNN)” to simultaneously process different 2D views of the 3D object (Leng et al.,
    [2015b](#bib.bib81)). Different views are sorted in a specific order to guarantee
    that all the objects’ views follow the same convention while training. The proposed
    3DCNN is composed of four Conv layers, three sub-sampling layers and two FC layers.
    The proposed network was tested for retrieval task on the same datasets used for
    testing (Leng et al., [2015a](#bib.bib80)). However, the results showed that the

    for 3D object retrieval and recognition/classification tasks. In contrast to Leng’s
    model in (Leng et al., [2015b](#bib.bib81)), MVCNN processed multiple views for
    the 3D objects in no specific order using a view pooling layer. [1](#S0.F1 "Figure
    1 ‣ 0.0.1\. Deep learning architectures on multi-view data ‣ A survey on Deep
    Learning Advances on Different 3D Data Representations") shows the full architecture
    of the model. Two different setups to capture the 3D objects multi-views were
    tested. The first one rendered 12 views for the object by placing 12 equidistant
    virtual cameras surrounding the object while the other setup included 80 virtual
    views. MVCNN was pre-trained using $ImageNet1K$ dataset and fine-tuned on $ModelNet40$ (Wu
    et al., [2015a](#bib.bib143)). The proposed network has two parts, the first part
    is where the object’s views are processed separately and the second part is where
    the max pooling operation is taking place across all the processed views in the
    view-pooling layer, resulting in a single compact representation for the whole
    3D shape. In the view-pooling layer, the view with the maximal activation is the
    only one considered while ignoring all the other views with non-maximal activations.
    This means that only few views are contributing towards the final representation
    of the shape which causes a loss of the visual information. To overcome this problem,

    ShapeNet (Wu et al., [2015a](#bib.bib143)) on classification and retrieval tasks
    by a remarkable margin. In (Johns et al., [2016](#bib.bib68)) Johns et al. exploited
    multi-view data representation using CNNs by representing 3D objects under unconstrained
    camera trajectories with a set of 2D image pairs. The proposed method classifies
    each pair separately and then weight the contribution of each pair to get the
    final result. The VGG-M architecture was adopted in this framework consists of
    five Conv layers and three FC layers. The views of the 3D objects are represented
    as either depth images or grayscale images or both. This model outperformed MVCNN
    proposed by Su et al. (Su et al., [2015](#bib.bib125)) and voxel-based ShapeNet
    architectures (Wu et al., [2015a](#bib.bib143)).

    and Minto, [2017](#bib.bib155)), Zanuttigh and Minto proposed a multi-branch CNN
    for classifying 3D objects. The input to this model is rendered depth maps from
    different view points for the 3D object. Each CNN branch consists of five Conv
    layers to process one depth map producing a classification vector. The resulted
    classification vectors are the input to a linear classifier to identify the 3D
    object’s category/class. The proposed model produced comparable results to the
    state-of-the-art. Based on the dominant sets, Want et al. in (Wang et al., [2017b](#bib.bib135))
    proposed recurrent view-clustering and pooling layers . The key concept in this
    model is to pool similar views and recurrently cluster them to build a pooled
    feature vector. Then, the constructed pooled feature vectors are fed as inputs
    in the same layer in a recurrent training fashion in the recurrent clustering
    layer. Within this layer, a view similarity graph is computed whose nodes represent
    the feature vectors and the edges represent the similarity weights between the
    views. Within the constructed graph, the similarities and dissimilarities between
    different views are exhibited which is very effective in the 3D shape recognition
    task. The proposed model achieved a highly comparable results to previous methods
     (Wu et al., [2015a](#bib.bib143); Su et al., [2015](#bib.bib125)) as shown in
    Table 1 in the supplementary material. Driven the advances in the multi-view DL
    models, Qi et al. (Qi et al., [2016b](#bib.bib101)) provided a comparison study
    between multi-view DL techniques and volumetric DL techniques for the object recognition
    task. As part of the study, the authors proposed a $Sphererendering$ approach
    for filtering multi-resolution 3D objects at multiple scales. With data augmentation,
    the authors managed to enhance the results of MVCNNs on $ModelNet40$. Recently,
    Kanezaki et at. (Kanezaki et al., [2016](#bib.bib70)) achieved state-of-the-art
    results on both $ModelNet10$ and $ModelNet40$ in the classification problem using
    $RotationNet$. $RotationNet$ trains a set of multi-view images for the 3D object
    but doesn’t require all the views at once. Instead, it allows for sequential input
    and updates the likelihood of the object’s category accordingly.

    representation with less computational power needed. However, there are some challenges
    imposed with this representation. The sufficient number of views and the way they
    were acquired is a critical factor for representing the 3D shape. Also, the multi-view
    representation does not preserve the intrinsic geometric properties of the 3D
    shape. This is what pushed towards defining new notion of convolution operating
    on 3D shapes to capture their intrinsic properties.

    advantages that each representation brings. Recently, Wang et al. proposed  (Wang
    et al., [2015](#bib.bib137)), where each of the 3D objects are represented by
    a pair of multi-views and 2D sketches. The learning model is composed of Siamese
    CNNs where are two identical sub-convolutional networks; one for processing the
    multi-views input and the other one is for processing the 2D sketches. Each of
    these network consisted of three Conv layers where each of them was succeeded
    by a max-pooling layer and a Fully Connected Layer. The networks were trained
    separately using the “Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)” method. The proposed
    model was tested on SHREC’13 dataset for 3D shape retrieval and achieved competitive
    results compared to previous methods. Wang et al. continued their investigations
    for hybrid 3D data representations and in (Wang et al., [2016](#bib.bib139)),
    the authors proposed the “Convolutional Auto-Encoder Extreme Learning Machine
    (CAE-ELM)” 3D descriptor which merges the learning power of ConvNets, AEs and
    “Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)” (Huang et al., [2006](#bib.bib65)). ELM is an
    efficient unsupervised learning technique which learns high-level discriminative
    features about the input data. ELM is faster than most of DL models (Kasun et al.,
    [2013](#bib.bib71)) which is practical for processing large-scale 3D data. The
    input to the CAE-ELM architecture is two data representations: voxel data and
    “Signed Distance Field data (SDF)”. Voxel data explains the structure of the 3D
    object while the SDF extracts local and global features about the 3D object. CAE-ELM
    was tested on $ModelNet40$ and $ModelNet10$ datasets for classification tasks
    and achieved a superior performance compared to previous methods. CAE-ELM is considered
    as a hybrid approach that exploits the structure of the 3D objects in addition
    to 3D descriptors. Ben-Shabat et al. (Ben-Shabat et al., [2017](#bib.bib12)) proposed
    a novel 3D point cloud representation named “3D Modified Fisher Vectors (3DmFV)”
    which is a kind of DL model that uses a hybrid data representation of the discrete
    structure of a grid with the continuous generalization of Fisher vectors to represent
    the 3D data. The hybrid input data is processed using deep ConvNet for classification
    and part segmentation tasks. 3DmFV has two modules: the initial one changes the
    input point cloud into a 3D modified “Fisher vector (FV)” which can be considered
    as a descriptor-based representation and the second one is the DL module represented
    in the CNN. FV data representation empowers the proposed framework to become order,
    input data sample size and structure invariant. The network architecture is composed
    of an inception module (Szegedy et al., [2017](#bib.bib129)), max-pooling layers

    and 2D representation (2D views) for the object classification task. Authors have
    examined different models for processing the data for $ModelNet$ classification.
    The model one was a combination of both modalities (3D and 2D) while using two
    3D CNNs for processing the 3D voxels and AlexNet for processing the 2D views.
    The other experiments were carried by processing the 3D voxels only and compare
    it with the performance of AlexNet on the 2D views. Experiments showed that that
    network that combined both modalities called $FusionNet$ performed the best. However,
    the multi-view network performed better than the volumetric CNNs. Although Brock
    et al. in  (Brock et al., [2016](#bib.bib16)) has achieved a state-of-the-art
    results on $ModelNet$ classification, $FusionNet$ achieved comparable results

    researchers to leverage the surface information provided in 3D meshes where the
    connectivity between vertices can be exploited to define local pseudo-coordinates
    to perform a convolution-like operation on 3D meshes. At the same time, some efforts

    the 3D surface geometry without the combinatorial irregularities and complexities
    of meshes. That is why point clouds are easy to learn from. However, processing
    point clouds is tricky due to their dual nature. Point clouds can be seen as a
    Euclidean-structured data locally when considering a point with respect to its
    neighborhood (a subset of points) such that the interaction among the points forms
    a Euclidean space with a distance metric which is invariant to transformations
    like translation, rotation. However, considering the global structure of the point
    cloud, it is an unordered set of points with no specific order which imposes the
    irregular non-Euclidean nature on the global structure of the data.

    different sizes. Vinyals et al. in (Vinyals et al., [2015](#bib.bib134)) use a
    read-process-write network for processing point sets to show the network ability
    to learn how to sort numbers. This was a direct application of DL on an unordered
    set for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) application. Inspired by this work,
    Ravanbakhsh et al. (Ravanbakhsh et al., [2016](#bib.bib104)), proposed what they
    called the permutation equivariant layer within a supervised and semi-supervised
    settings. This layer is obtained by parameter-sharing to learn the permutation
    invariance as well as rigid transformations across the data. This network performed
    3D classification and MNIST digit addition. Although this network is relatively
    simple, it didn’t perform well on the 3D classification task on ModelNet dataset.
    A deeper version of this model was extended in (Zaheer et al., [2017](#bib.bib154))
    where the proposed $DeepSet$ framework produced better results than the state-of-the-art
    methods in 3D classification job on $ModelNet$ dataset. This is due to the permutation
    invariance property that the permutation equivarant layer is bringing to the previous
    models. (Qi et al., [2016a](#bib.bib99)) also used a similar layer with a major
    difference as the permutation equivariant layer is max-normalized.

    use of the point cloud as an input where each of its points is represented using
    the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates. As a pre-processing step, feature transformation and
    inputs are feeded into the $PointNet$ architecture. $PointNet$ is composed of
    three main modules: a “Spatial Transformer Network (STN)” module, an RNN module
    and a simple symmetric function that aggregates all the information from each
    point in the point cloud. The STN canonicalizes the data before feeding them to
    the RNN, i.e., process all the data into one canonical form, and learns the key
    points of the point cloud which approximately corresponds to the skeleton of the
    3D object. Then comes the RNN module which learns the point cloud like a sequential
    signal of points and while training this model with some randomly permuted sequence,
    this RNN becomes invariant to the sequence of the input order of the point cloud’s
    point. Lastly, the network aggregates all the resulted point features using the
    max-pooling operation which is also permutation invariant. $PointNet$ proved that
    it is robust against partial data and input perturbation. It was tested on classification
    and segmentation tasks where it proved to produce results comparable to the state-of-the-art

    applying it to a nested partition of the input point sets. Despite capturing more
    features, the resulted architecture is complicated which increases the size of

    weights across the points of the tree. Kd-tree is a feed-forward network that
    has learnable parameters associated with the weights of the nodes in the tree.
    This model was tested for shape classification, shape retrieval and shape part
    segmentation producing competitive results. Following the same concept of not
    working directly on the point cloud structure, Roveri et al. (Roveri et al., [2018](#bib.bib106))
    proposed to extract a set of 2D depth maps from different views of the point cloud
    and process them using Residual Nets ($ResNet50$) (He et al., [2015](#bib.bib59)).
    The proposed framework contains 3 modules. The initial module is responsible of
    learning $k$ directional views of the input point cloud to generate the depth
    maps accordingly in the second module. The third and last module is processing
    the generated $k$ depth maps for object classification. The innovation of this
    framework is mainly focus on automatically transforming un-ordered point clouds
    to informative 2D depth maps without the need to adapt the network module to account
    for permutation invariance and different transformations of the input data.

    clouds by a novel folding-based decoder that deforms a 2D canonical grid into

    to generate cuts on the 2D grid to create 3D surfaces and generalize to some intra-class

    to be used for 3D classification where it proved to perform well with the learned
    discriminative representation for different 3D objects. FoldingNet achieved high
    classification accuracy on $ModelNet40$. Another unsupervised model was proposed

    invariant network that can tolerate unordered point clouds inputs. SO-Net builds
    that spatial distribution of the points in the point cloud using “Self-Organizing
    Maps (SOMs)”. Then, a hierarchical feature extraction on the points of the point
    cloud and the SOM nodes is employed which results in a singular feature vector
    which represents the entire point cloud Local feature aggregation happens according
    to an adjustable receptive field where the overlap is controlled to get more effective

- en: 'Spectral filtering methods. The notion of spectral convolution on graph-structured
    data was introduced by Bruna et al. in (Bruna et al., [2013](#bib.bib24)) where
    the authors proposed Spectral CNN (SCNN) operating on graphs. The foundation of
    the spectral filtering methods is to use the spectral eigen-decomposition of the
    graph Laplacian to define a convolution-like operator. This redefines the convolution
    operation in the spectral domain where the main two core stones are analogous:
    the patches of the signal in the Euclidean domain correspond to the functions
    defined on the graph nodes e.g. features, mapped to the spectral domain by projecting
    on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. The filtering operation itself happens
    in the Euclidean domain and corresponds to scaling the signals in the eigenbasis.
    This definition implies that convolution is a linear operator that commutes with
    the Laplacian operator (Bronstein et al., [2017](#bib.bib21)). Despite the innovation
    aspect of Bruna’s model, it has serious limitations due to being basis dependent
    and computationally expensive. Being basis-dependent means that if the spectral
    filter’s coefficients were learned with respect to a specific basis, applying
    the learned coefficients on another domain with another basis will produce very
    different results as illustrated in (Bronstein et al., [2017](#bib.bib21)). The
    other limitation of being computationally costly arises from the fact that spectral
    filtering is a non-local operation that involves data across the whole graph besides
    that the graph Laplacian is expensive to compute. This constitutes a computational
    burden towards generalizing to other bases and processing large-scale graphs.'

- en: The work in (Kovnatsky et al., [2013](#bib.bib76)) addressed the basis dependency
    problem by constructing a compatible orthogonal basis across various domains through
    a joint diagonalization. However, this required a prior knowledge about the correspondence
    between the domains. For some applications like social networks, this is a valid
    assumption because the correspondence can be easily computed between two time
    instances in which new edges and vertices have been added. However, applying this
    on meshes is rather unreasonable because finding correspondence between two meshes
    is challenging task on its own. Therefore, assuming the knowledge of correspondence
    between domains in such case is unrealistic (Bronstein et al., [2017](#bib.bib21)).
    Since the non-local nature of the spectral filtering and the need to involve all
    the graph data in the processing, recent works proposed the idea of approximation
    to produce local spectral filters (Defferrard et al., [2016](#bib.bib37)) (Kipf
    and Welling, [2016](#bib.bib74)). These methods propose to represent the filters
    via a polynomial expansion instead of directly operating on the spectral domain.
    Defferrard et al. in  (Defferrard et al., [2016](#bib.bib37)) performed local
    spectral filtering on graphs by using Chebyshev polynomials in order to approximate
    the spectral graph filters. The features yielding from the convolution operation
    are then coarsened using the graph pooling operation. Kipf and Welling (Kipf and
    Welling, [2016](#bib.bib74)) simplified the polynomial approximation proposed
    in (Defferrard et al., [2016](#bib.bib37)) and used a first-order linear approximation
    of the graph spectral filters to produce local spectral filters which are then
    employed in a two-layer GCNN. Each of these two layers uses the local spectral
    filters and aggregates the information from the immediate neighbourhood of the
    vertices. Note that the filters proposed in (Defferrard et al., [2016](#bib.bib37))
    and  (Kipf and Welling, [2016](#bib.bib74)) are employed on r- or 1-hop neighbourhood
    of the graph returns these constructions into the spatial domain.

    GCNNs in the pointNet++ framework (Qi et al., [2017b](#bib.bib102)) to process
    unordered point clouds. This model fuses the innovation of the pointNet++ framework
    with local spectral filtering while addressing two shortcomings of these models
    independently. Therefore, instead of processing each point independently in the
    point clouds as proposed in pointNet++, this model uses spectral filtering as
    a learning technique to change the structural information of each points’ neighborhood.
    Moreover, rather than using the greedy winner-takes all method in the graph max
    pooling operation, this method adopts a recursive pooling and clustering strategy.
    Unlike the previous spectral filtering methods, this method does not require any
    pre-computation and it is trainable by an end-to-end manner which allows building
    the graph dynamically and computing the graph Laplacian and the pooling hierarchy
    on the fly unlike (Bruna et al., [2013](#bib.bib24); Defferrard et al., [2016](#bib.bib37);

- en: Spatial filtering methods. The concept of graph spatial filtering started in (Scarselli
    et al., [2009](#bib.bib112)) when GNNs were first proposed as an attempt to generalize
    DL models to graphs. GNNs are simple constructions that try to generalize the
    notion of spatial filtering on graphs via the weights of the graph. GNNs are composed
    of multiple layers where each layer is a linear combination of graph high-pass
    and low-pass operators. This formulation suggests that learning the graph features
    is dependent on each vertex’s neighborhood. Similar to Euclidean CNNs, a non-linear
    function is applied to all the nodes of the graph where the choice of this function
    varies depending on the task. Varying the nature of the vertex non-linear function
    lead to rich architectures (Li et al., [2015](#bib.bib84); Sukhbaatar et al.,
    [2016](#bib.bib126); Duvenaud et al., [2015](#bib.bib40); Chang et al., [2016](#bib.bib29);
    Battaglia et al., [2016](#bib.bib11)). Also, analogous to CNNs, pooling operation
    can be employed on graph-structured data by graph coarsening. Graph pooling layers
    can be performed by interleaving the graph learning layers. In comparison with
    the spectral graph filtering, spatial filtering methods have two key points which
    distinguish them from spectral methods. Spatial methods aggregate the feature
    vectors from the neighborhood nodes directly based on the graph topology considering
    the spatial structure of the input graph. The aggregated features are then summarized
    via an additional operation. The GNN framework presented in (Scarselli et al.,
    [2009](#bib.bib112); Gori et al., [2005](#bib.bib50)), proposed to embed each
    vertex in the graph into a Euclidean space with an RNN. Instead of using the recursive
    connections in the RNN, the authors used a simple diffusion function for their
    transition function, propagating the node representation repeatedly until it is
    stable and fixed. The resulting node representations are considered as the features
    for classification and regression problems. The repeated propagation for node
    features in this framework constitutes a computational burden which is alleviated
    in the work proposed by Li et al. (Li et al., [2015](#bib.bib84)). They have proposed
    a variant of the previous model which uses the gated recurrent units to perform
    the state updates to learn the optimal graph representation. Bruna et al. in (Bruna
    et al., [2013](#bib.bib24)) imposed the spatial local receptive field on GNN to
    produce their local spatial formulation of GNN. The main idea behind the local
    receptive field is to decrease the number of the learned parameters by grouping
    similar features based on a similarity measure (Coates and Ng, [2011](#bib.bib32);
    Gregor and LeCun, [2010](#bib.bib51)). In (Bruna et al., [2013](#bib.bib24)),
    the authors used this concept to compute a multi-scale clustering of the graph
    to be fed to the pooling layer afterwards. This model imposes locality on the
    processed features and reduces the amount of processed parameters. However, it
    doesn’t perform any weight sharing similar to 2D CNNs. Niepert et al.in (Niepert
    et al., [2016](#bib.bib95)) performs spatial graph convolution in a simple way
    by converting the graph locally into sequences and feeding these sequences into
    a 1D CNN. This method is simple but requires an explicit definition for the nodes
    orders of the graphs in a pre-processing step. In (Venkatakrishnan et al., [2018](#bib.bib132)),
    the authors provided a detailed study proving that spectral methods and spatial
    methods are mathematically equivalent in terms of their representation capabilities.
    The difference resides in how the convolution and the aggregation of the learned
    features are performed. Depending on the task, the architecture of the GCNN (spectral
    or spatial) is formed where the convolution layers may be interleaved with coarsening
    and pooling layers to summarize the output of the convolution filters for a compact
    representation of the graph. This is crucial in classification applications where
    the output is only one class inferred from the learned features (Bruna et al.,
    [2013](#bib.bib24)). Some other applications require a decision per node such
    as community detection. A common practice in such cases is to have multiple convolution
    layers that compute the graph representations at the node level  (Khalil et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib73); Nowak et al., [2017](#bib.bib97); Bruna and Li, [2017](#bib.bib23)).
    All these GCNNs are end-to-end differentiable methods that can be trained in supervised,
    semi-supervised or reinforcement learning techniques.

- en: 'Meshes: On the Euclidean domain, the convolution operation is performed by
    passing a template at each point on the spatial domain and recording the correlation
    between the templates using the function that is defined at this point. This is
    feasible due to the shift-invariance property on the Euclidean domain. Howeverm,
    unfortunately, this is not directly applicable on meshes because there is a lack
    of the shift-invariance property. This is what pushed towards defining local patches
    that represent the 3D surface in a way that allows performing convolution. However,
    due to the lack of global parametrization on non-Euclidean data, these patches
    are defined in a local system of coordinates locally meaning that these patches
    are also position-dependent. Recently, various non-Euclidean CNNs frameworks were
    proposed. The main schema used by these frameworks is very similar except for
    how the patches are defined mostly. The local patches are defined either by handcrafting
    them or depending on the connectivity of the vertices while using the features
    of the 1-hop neighborhood as the patch directly (Fey et al., [2017](#bib.bib47)).
    The convolution employed in such frameworks is very similar to the classical 2D
    convolution where it is basically an element-wise multiplication between the convolution
    filter and the patch and summing up the results. This is because the patches extracted
    by such frameworks boils down the representation into 2D where the classical convolution
    can be employed.'

- en: Geodesic CNN (Masci et al., [2015](#bib.bib92)) was introduced as a generalization
    of classical CNNs to triangular meshes. The main idea of this approach is to construct
    local patches in local polar coordinates. The values of the functions around each
    vertex in the mesh are mapped into local polar coordinates using the patch operator.
    This defines the patches where the geodesic convolution is employed. Geodesic
    convolution follows the idea of multiplication by a template. However, the convolution
    filters in this framework are subjected to some arbitrary rotations due to the
    angular coordinate ambiguity (Masci et al., [2015](#bib.bib92)). This method opened
    the door for new innovations on extending CNN paradigm to triangular meshes. However,
    this framework suffers from multiple drawbacks. First, it can only be applied
    on triangular meshes where it is sensitive to the triangulation of the mesh and
    it might fail if the mesh is extremely irregular. Second, the radius of the constructed
    geodesic patch has to be small with respect to the injectivity radius of the actual
    shape to guarantee that the resulted patch is topologically a disk. Third, the
    rotations employed on the convolution filters make the framework computationally
    expensive which limits the usage of such a framework. Anisotropic CNN (ACNN) (Boscaini
    et al., [2016](#bib.bib15)) was proposed to overcome some of the limitations in
    the geodesic CNN. Compared to the geodesic CNN, the ACNN framework is not limited
    to triangular meshes and can be also applied to graphs. Also, the construction
    of the local patches is simpler and is independent on the injectivity radius of
    the mesh. ACNN uses the concept of spectral filtering where the spatial information
    is also incorporated by a weighting function to extract a local function defined
    on the meshes. The learnt spectral filters are applied to the eigenvalues of the
    anisotropic Laplacian Beltrami Operator (LBO) and the anisotropic heat kernels
    act as a spatial weighting functions for the convolution filters. This method
    has shown a very good performance for local correspondence tasks. Rather than
    using a fixed kernel construction as in the previous models, Monti et al. (Monti
    et al., [2017](#bib.bib94)) proposed $MoNet$ as a general construction of patches.
    The authors proposed to define a local system of coordinates of pseudo-coordinates
    around each vertex with weight functions. On these coordinates, a set of parametric
    kernels are applied on these pseudo-coordinates to define the weighting functions
    at each vertex. That is why the previous methods (Masci et al., [2015](#bib.bib92);
    Boscaini et al., [2016](#bib.bib15)) can be considered as specific instances of
    MoNet. Some recent work has been proposed to eliminate the need to explicitly
    define the local patches on the graphs or meshes such as SplineCNN (Fey et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib47)). SplineCNN is a convolutional framework that can be employed
    on directed graphs of any dimensionality. Hence, it can also be applied on meshes.
    Instead of defining the local patches by a charting-based method like the previous
    methods, SplineCNN uses the 1-hop neighborhood ring features of the graph as the
    patch where the convolutional filter can operate. The convolutional filter itself
    is a spatial continuous filter based on B-Spline basis functions that have local
    support. This framework produces state-of-the-art results on the correspondence
    task while being computationally very efficient. This is due to the local support
    of the B-Spline basis which makes the computational time independent of the kernel
    size.

    CNN (MVCNN) (Su et al., [2015](#bib.bib125)) applies a max-pooling operation on
    the features of each view to produce global features that represent the 3D object.
    The max-pooling ignores the non-maximal activation and only keeps the maximal
    ones from a specific view which results into losing some visual cues (Su et al.,
    [2015](#bib.bib125)). Yu et al. (Yu et al., [2018](#bib.bib153)) tried to incorporate

    extracts the features from each view but does not apply any pooling. It matches
    views to find the similarity between two 3D objects. It counts the best matched
    views only, however the greedy selection of the best matched view may discard
    useful information. Another framework called Group View CNN (GVCNN) (Feng et al.,

- en: 3D object retrieval is another fundamental task in shape analysis. The target
    here is to find the most similar 3D object from a database to match with the tested
    one. However, in the literature, most DNNs focus on leveraging the discrimination
    strength of these networks for the classification and recognition tasks. There
    are less DNNs specifically designed for 3D shape retrieval, see Table 2 in the
    supplementary material. Conceptually, the input processing is similar to the classification
    and recognition tasks. Generally, 3D object retrieval approaches are similar to
    other image or object retrieval methods where several loss functions are trained
    to learn an embedding space to get elements closer to each other. A very recent
    work (He et al., [2018](#bib.bib61)) train the center loss (Wen et al., [2016](#bib.bib140))
    and triplet loss (Schroff et al., [2015](#bib.bib113)) specifically for the distance
    measure which superpasses the state-of-the-art on $ModelNet40$ and $ShapeNet$.
    Multi-view methods usually outperform other methods in terms of retrieval accuracy.
    A comprehensive list of the recent 3D object retrieval state-of-the-art methods
    is given in Table 2 in the supplementary material.

    of a test mesh and a reference or template mesh. There are two types of correspondences;
    sparse and dense correspondence. Sparse correspondence means that only a subset
    of the vertices of the test mesh are mapped to the reference mesh. However, in
    dense correspondence, all the vertices of the test mesh are mapped to the reference
    mesh.

    perform 3D shape correspondence on the registered meshes of FAUST dataset (Bogo
    et al., [2014](#bib.bib14)). Only registered meshes of the dataset are considered
    because they are in dense point-to-point correspondence, providing the ground
    truth. There are in total 100 registered meshes of 10 people in 10 different poses
    each. Since the meshes are registrations of a template mesh, the number of vertices
    is fixed and the connectivity pattern is identical. In previous works, the task
    is cast as a classification problem. The model has to map $N$ input vertices to
    the corresponding vertices on the template mesh. This is achieved with a one-hot
    encoding of the target vertex for each input vertex.

    and $20$ meshes for training and testing respectively. The results show very high
    accuracy in the correspondence prediction. Those results are very accurate, but
    seem to mostly reflect the simplicity of the experiment. In fact, the meshes of
    the dataset all have the same topology, i.e., the vertices are in the same order
    and the connectivity pattern is the same. Moreover, because of the registration,
    the vertices are already in dense one-to-one correspondence. There is thus no
    ambiguity in the possible assignments with neighboring vertices. This makes the
    correspondence task simple because the mapping from input vertices to ouput vertices
    is a trivial copy rather than learning the actual topology of the 3D mesh.

    generated subjects. We have used a pre-trained model such as SplineCNN to test

    The initial row of meshes shows four of the original test meshes of FAUST dataset
    without adding any noise. The following rows show different levels of added noise
    from level 1 (lowest noise) to level 4 (highest). The mesh shown on the left represents
    the reference mesh and the set of meshes on the right show the correspondence
    results. For level 1 noise (second row), the geometry of meshes has barely changed
    with respect to the original meshes (first row), except for some noise on the
    faces. However, the correspondence results show that there are some erroneous
    areas in the arms for the ‘hands up pose’ (last pose from the left), which should
    not be the case since the arms did not change. Moreover, the more noisy the mesh
    is, the more the correspondence results get erroneous in terms of the wrongly
    labelled vertices and this is clear in terms if the difference in the color map
    between the reference mesh and the test meshes.

- en: Real mesh data is more challenging because it is more noisy, incomplete and
    less regular with variable sampling. Because of the noise, the vertices of an
    input mesh do not have an exact correspondence with the template mesh, making
    the correspondence ambiguous. Also, the connectivity pattern usually varies from
    mesh to another even if re-sampled to the same number of vertices. Possible holes
    in the data make it hard to find the exact correspondence to the reference mesh.
    Variability in the sampling requires robust methods that can adapt to different
    scales and handle different levels of features. Recently, Monte Carlo Convolution (Hermosilla
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib63)) is proposed to handle sampling at different levels
    for point clouds learning. The authors in this work propose to represent the convolution
    kernel as a “Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)” where the convolution is formulated
    as a Monte Carlo intergration problem. This notion enables to combine information
    of the point cloud from multiple samplings at different levels, where Poisson
    disk sampling is used as a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning.
    This showed robustness even when all the training data is non-uniformly samples.
    This method achieves relatively better results compared to PointNet++ (Qi et al.,
    [2017b](#bib.bib102)).

    We down-sample 10 meshes of the 3DBodyTex dataset to 6890 vertices to be equivalent
    to the number of vertices of FAUST dataset. However, the down-sampled data have
    different connectivity pattern from the FAUST data, which makes the task of the
    correspondence harder. As depicted in Fig. [6](#S1.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 1.2.3\. 3D Correspondence

    results in highly erroneous correspondence results where the resulting color map
    on the test data is very far from the color map of the reference mesh.

- en: The ongoing evolution of scanning devices caused a huge increase in the amount
    of 3D data available in the 3D computer vision research community. This opens
    the door for new opportunities investigating the properties of different 3D objects
    and learning their geometric properties despite challenges imposed by the data
    itself. Fortunately, DL techniques revolutionized the learning performance on
    various 2D computer vision tasks which encouraged the 3D research community to
    adopt the same path. However, extending 2D DL to 3D data is not a straightforward
    tasks depending on the data representation itself and the task at hand. In this
    work, we categorized the 3D data representations based on their internal structure
    to Euclidean and non-Euclidean representations. Following the same classification,
    we discussed different DL techniques applied to 3D data based on the data representation
    and how the internal structure of the data is treated. In the Euclidean DL family,
    the reported results in the literature shows that multi-view representations achieve
    the state-of-the-art classification performance and outperforms other methods
    that exploit the full geometry of the 3D shape (i.e., volumetric methods) providing
    a more efficient way to learn the properties of 3D shapes. On the other branch
    of the non-Euclidean DL techniques, results are reported near perfect on the correspondence
    task in various recent papers such as (Fey et al., [2017](#bib.bib47); Verma et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib133)). These correspondence experiments were carried on clean,
    smooth and ideal data. In this paper, state-of-the-art SplineCNN (Fey et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib47)) method have been tested over different dataset, under different
    different conditions that emulate the real-world scenarios. The obtained results
    showed that, even with the same topology and similar poses, this model does not
    generalize to new or noisy data. There is clearly a need to further investigate
    ways to improve the robustness of 3D DL models and ensure their generalization
    to real data while exploiting the different existent representations of 3D data.
