- en: Regression has attracted immense interest lately due to its effectiveness in
    tasks like predicting values. And Regression is of widespread use in multiple
    fields such as Economics, Finance, Business, Biology and so on. While considerable
    studies have proposed some impressive models, few of them have provided a whole
    picture regarding how and to what extent Regression has developed. With the aim
    of aiding beginners in understanding the relationships among different Regression
    algorithms, this paper characterizes a broad and thoughtful selection of recent
    regression algorithms, providing an organized and comprehensive overview of existing
    work and models utilized frequently. In this paper, the relationship between Regression
    and Deep Learning is also discussed and a conclusion can be drawn that Deep Learning
    can be more powerful as an combination with Regression models in the future.

- en: Regression is an approach of obtaining a relationship between input space and
    output space. The relationship is represented by a function $f:X\longmapsto Y$
    and $X$ is known as the independent variable, and $Y$ as the dependent variable.
    It was originally put forward by Legendre [[1](#bib.bib1)] in 1805, who applied
    least squares in Regression. And then Gauss [[2](#bib.bib2)] published a further
    development of the theory of least squares featuring ordinary least squares in
    1821.

    R$. Undoubtedly, Regression is powerful and has made tremendous impact in enormous
    fields. As such, an increasing number of research has made fundamental improvement
    to Regression models over the past few decades.

    and beginners may find it challenging to figure out what exactly every model means
    and the relationship between them. Thus, a survey of the existing Regression models
    is beneficial both to beginners who just want to scratch the surface of Regression
    and researchers willing to have a systematic view of Regression models and gain
    insight from those smart models.

    producing an unbiased linear model of minimum variance as long as six necessary
    assumptions is satisfied according to Gauss-Markov Theorem [[2](#bib.bib2)]. However,
    if OLS is applied in specific areas, some of the assumptions are likely to be
    violated so that OLS fails to play its part in predicting values. Hence, it is
    essential to grasp those assumptions and figure out possible solutions when one
    of them is broken. And those well-known concerns with OLS contributes to extensive
    models designed to fix those violations such as Ridge [[3](#bib.bib3)][[4](#bib.bib4)],
    Lasso [[5](#bib.bib5)], Elastic Net [[6](#bib.bib6)] and so on.

    is OLS-centered and alternative solutions provided by different models are discussed
    at length when some assumptions are broken (Figure 1). This paper views the relationship
    between models on the whole and discusses the details of distinct models specifically
    and explicitly. And this paper also provides a walk-through of some uncommon Regression
    models. What’s more, a possible direction to which Regression is going to develop
    is covered.

    and convention in this paper is included in Section 2\. In Section 3, OLS, its
    assumptions and possible solutions for violation are comprehensively explained.
    Section 4 is composed of a number of Regression models which enable OLS’s potential
    to be stimulated although the real data challenges its assumptions and some unexpected
    situations happen. Generalized Linear Models and an uncommon Regression named
    as Step-Wise are explored in Section 5\. Section 6 sets out to provide a quick
    overview of the strong bond between Regression and Deep Learning. In Section 7,
    conclusions about Regression are drawn and possible combination of Regression
    and Deep Learning in the future is discussed. In a nutshell, this well-established
    paper is an overview of Regression models and the relationship between Regression
    and Deep Learning, and hopefully this paper does make sense.

    it in unknown test sets. A standard for machine performs well is that low residuals(distance
    from predicted values to labels). When it comes to regression task, it is common
    way to implement Linear Regression.

    $\theta$ explains when $x$ changes to what extent $\hat{y}$ is going to change.
    $X=\left\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\right\}$ is known as input space and $Y=\left\{y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n}\right\}$
    as output space. $x_{i}$ is called a sample, and $x_{ij}$ means the j-th feature
    of the i-th sample. $y$ is the label and $\hat{y}$ is the prediction. And $\epsilon$
    is the error accompanied by every prediction and is also called the distance from
    $\hat{y}$ to $y$(residual). In ordinary least squares, the model assumes that
    $y$ is actually sampled from Gaussian Distribution and every sample is with noise.
    Thus, it can also called noise in statistics. But in this paper, I am going to
    use error for that.

    function, which is also known as cost function. OLS(Ordinary Least Squares) serves
    as an effective loss function as long as the model satisfies six necessary assumptions.
    Then it can choose an unbiased model of minimum variance by minimizing the function
    below. And $J(\theta)$ is convex. Thus, set partial derivative of $\theta$ zero
    and then we can get the best parameter $\theta^{*}$. Note that only when $X^{T}X$
    is full rank, equation(3) does make sense. Some books may multiply $J(\theta)$
    by $1/n$, which is convenient for computation. Note that $X$ and $Y$ are matrices.

    between $X$ and $y$ is a non-linear model, e.g. $y=X^{4}$, the whole regression
    model crashes. And the recipe for this situation is applying feature transformation.
    By doing so, the whole relationship between $X$ and $y$ is changed for good. Hence,
    we must also take the correlation between $X$ and $y$ into consideration. Correlation
    can be told by calculating $R^{2}$ (Coefficient Of Determination), which stands
    for the ability to predict $y$ by observing $X$. When $R^{2}=1$, it means the
    loss of this predictor is 0\. If $R^{2}=0$, it is equivalent to that the predictor
    is constant, which indicates $X$ has nothing to do with $y$. As shown in Table
    1, in Column $R^{2}$, the value in bracket stands for the original coefficient.
    And the same goes for Column Linearity. Note that I use 10000 random points from
    $y=2(X-3)^{2}+5+N$, which N stands for noise and it varies from 0 to 1\. X follows
    random and even distribution.

    means y w.r.t transformed X. And if so, scatter plot of original X and predicted
    y should fit the original distribution plot. This assumption is the most significant
    for Linear Regression and it may explain why Ridge or Lasso also performs badly

    we can get a bunch of predicted values via observing $X$. Then we can calculate
    errors between true values and predicted values. And we can also calculate the
    variance of errors. If errors follow normal distribution (equation 5), thus its
    variance is constant($\sigma^{2}$). Also, its distribution is symmetrical. In
    turn, the distribution of errors should also be uniform and symmetrical. So we
    can use error plot to detect it (Figure 3). And Q-Q Plot can detect whether the
    errors follow normal distribution. The data I use can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction).

    transformation e.g. Log. As shown in Figure 4, it can, to some degree, make our

    then the variance of noise(error) is a constant($\sigma^{2}$). Thus,normality
    of data is likely to relieve heteroscedasticity. And data can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-%0Alearning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv).

    should be $i.i.d$(independent identically distributed). When a financial crisis
    happens, the shares is going to be extremely unstable in next few months,which
    means errors are going to increase sharply. It can be detected by Durbin Watson
    Test(Table 3) or drawing AC Plot. And if values of y axis in AC Plot vary from

    means the real prediction is not based on $X$, then there’s exogeneity [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    And the best solution is to make a good analysis about what on earth affects our
    predicted values and choose a suitable $X$.

    sets, however, this is an invitation to poor performance on testing sets, which
    is also known as overfitting. Generally speaking, the more complicated a model
    is, the poorer performance of the model on unknown sets. According to Occam’s
    rule, a model is more likely to do a good job on unknown sets if the model is
    simple. And the model is of high generalization ability.'

- en: Shrinkage. When OLS is applied in real life, the predictor’s coefficients can
    be too large in absolute. The coefficient of variable more correlated to $y$ is
    large while the one of variable less correlated to $y$ is also large,which is
    misleading to figure out the relationship between $X$ and $y$ [[3](#bib.bib3)].
    This phenomenon can account for poor performance on unknown sets. Thus, Ridge
    is going to implement shrinkage on coefficients and the extent of shrinkage counts
    on the degree of correlation. Typically, if a variable holds much predicting power,
    its coefficient is more likely to be big [[4](#bib.bib4)].

- en: Nonorthogonal Solution [[3](#bib.bib3)]. Whether OLS can be directly computed
    just by derivative relies mainly on if $X^{T}X$ is orthogonal. If $X^{T}X$ is
    nonorthogonal, this means $X^{T}X$ is not reversible and the direct computation
    can’t work. $I$ is a unit matrix. There’re only small positive quantity on the
    diagonal of $kI$, the diagonal looks like a ridge in comparison with zero’s distribution(equation
    9).

- en: Biased Model. The potential assumptions of Ridge are that $X^{T}X$ is nonorthogonal
    and coefficients need shrinkage. Hence, Ridge actually do a trade-off between
    bias and variance and it uses increased bias to obtain reduced variance. Because
    Ridge’s assumptions are correct in most cases, it is capable of producing a model
    with low variance.

- en: L2-Penalty. Equation 10 is Ridge’s loss function. The loss function means not
    only an accurate model is required, its coefficients should be small. And $\lambda/2||\theta_{i}||^{2}$
    is called L2-norm. This kind of method is known as regularization in the sense
    that the model generated by regularization is of high generalization ability.
    Except direct computation, gradient descent is a common way to get the best parameter.
    Ridge always minuses the coefficient vector(equation 11.1 & 11.2).

    quite powerful but shrinkage means it just cuts down on coefficients’ ability
    of affecting the result. As such, each coefficient still has influence on the
    result which further indicates Ridge still cares about every sample’s loss. However,
    when outliers appear in the data, Ridge fails to deal with them in that it is
    sensitive to outliers.'

- en: Feature Selection [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Unlike Ridge, Lasso implements feature selection
    because only one coefficient is saved and others are set zero, which is known
    as sparse solution. Therefore, only one sample has effect on the prediction in
    the sense that Lasso is insensitive to outliers and robust to small changes. Feature
    selection results in oscillation in optimization, which means Ridge is more stable
    than Lasso in gradient descent(Figure 7). What’s more, although Lasso has looked
    at all the data, only one sample does make sense. Thus, Lasso is also able to
    avoid overfitting. If performance of Lasso is excellent, then we can say which
    sample does work. So Lasso is an interpretable model compared to OLS and Ridge.

- en: L1-Penalty. Lasso minuses a constant in gradient descent(equation 13.1 & 13.2).
    Suppose we’re on the top of a mountain, what Lasso does is just move a bitter
    farther while Ridge just goes where seems more steap. Hence, Ridge is more faster
    than Lasso. So when values are quite large, Ridge should be a better choice than
    Lasso. But when values are small, Lasso should be a better choice.

- en: Margin Maximization. SVM(Support Vector Machine) is originally invented for
    classification problems [[9](#bib.bib9)]. Unlike other algorithms, SVM not only
    needs to classify all the data correctly but also requires the distance of data
    to the Hyper plane to be the biggest, which is known as widest street. Our linear
    model is $y=\theta^{T}X+b$. Among all the data points, the distance of the closest
    positive point to the hyper plane pluses the same distance of closest negative
    point is Margin($\gamma$). Then SVM is turned into maximizing Margin. And the
    same for SVR. We can turn the maximizing $\frac{2}{||\theta||}$ into minimizing
    $\frac{||\theta||^{2}}{2}$. Because $||\theta||$ is bigger than 0, $||\theta||^{2}$
    is proportional to $||\theta||$. Then the problem for SVR is like equation 15\.
    In equation 15, C is a coefficient for regularization and $L(x)$ is an undefined
    loss function.

- en: $\epsilon$- insensitive loss. SVR can tolerate mistakes which are no more than
    $\epsilon$, if those points predicted wrongly in dashed area $[f(x)-\epsilon,f(x)+\epsilon]$,
    then the losses of those points equal zero, which is called $\epsilon$-insensitive
    loss(Figure 8). In equation 16,z stands for loss. Actually, it just makes a trade-off
    between errors and complexity of the model. Hence, SVR is unlikely to overfit
    the data. Thus, SVR can reduce the variance of OLS.

    and leaf node. For instance, if we’re going to predict a man’s height. And we
    get men’s and women’s heights. Thus, the root node is man or not. If a point which
    we need to predict is $(68,171)$. It means the height of a man weighing 68kg is
    171cm. If we use tree regression, then our internal node is $>60?$ And the second
    internal node is $<70?$ and so on. And at last, the leaf node is the result we
    predict. Hence, the leaf node is the predicted height.

    selection,generating trees and pruning. CART assumes that decision tree is a Binary
    tree. The decision tree is equivalent to dividing features into two groups recursively.
    It divides the input space into limited units and predict the distribution. Suppose
    our data $D=\{(x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),\dots,(x_{n},y_{n})\}$. Decision Tree
    splits input space into $M$ units $R_{1},R_{2},\dots,R_{M}$ and at the end of
    every unit is the output value $c_{m}$. And we can minimize squared errors of
    output values and true values. And it’s obvious that the best output value in
    every unit should be the average value. But the question is that how to split
    the input space. And we choose $x_{j}$ randomly and its output value $s$. And
    we split the input space into two space by their output values. $R_{1}(j,s)=\{x|x_{j}\leq
    s\}$ and $R_{2}(j,s)=\{x|x_{j}>s\}$ $x_{j}$ is called splitting variable and $s$
    is splitting point. And we find $c_{1},c_{2}$ in $R_{1},R_{2}$ via squared least
    errors. We also want $c_{1}+c_{2}$ to be small enough. That’s how we finally get
    j, s.

    to make more accurate predictions. And if the size of data and the input space
    is quite large. The structure of the tree is complicated. Sadly, a complex model
    easily gives birth to Overfitting. So it’s necessary to make our model more simple.
    Therefore, from the bottom of the tree, we cut down some child trees. Then we
    can get a tree sequence $\{T_{0},T_{1},\dots,T_{n}\}$($T_{0}$ is the root node).
    Then we employ cross-validation to choose the best child tree from it. At the
    same time, we also expect our model to perform well. Hence, we apply a loss function
    to measure the differences of performances in the process of pruning. In equation(32),
    T is arbitrary child tree. C(T) means errors on the training data. $|T|$ is the
    number of leaf nodes in a child tree. $\alpha$ is a parameter, which decides the
    regularization term. If $\alpha$ is big, it means hard punishment and this results
    in a simple tree. If $\alpha$ is small, it means soft punishment and this leads
    to a more complicated tree respectively.

    model, which is called out of bag data. And $2/3$ of our data to be a new data
    set. Then we select subsets randomly from the new data set, which is known as
    Bagging. Every time we select one subset of the complete data set and then the
    subset is placed back. The number of points in different subsets is the same.
    We train different tree models for every different data. Finally we make an average
    of all trees’ variables as our final model variable in order to cut down on the
    variance. Hence, it’s an accurate model. And it is able to maintain accuracy although
    most of data is missing in that the model only randomly select a subset to train.
    However, it may overfit data when there’re some outliers in data.

    Forest. They both select the random subset and then a new tree is generated. In
    Random Forest, the probability of data is selected is the same, which is almost
    unbiased. But in Boosted Regression Tree, it is going to give weights to every
    data point. For instance, first time we select a subset and we build a tree model
    for it. Before this subset is placed back, prediction errors are calculated for
    every point. If the error is high, this point is likely to be given large weights,
    which indicates its probability of being selected is higher than others. To summarize,
    Boosted Regression Tree focuses on the errors and is going to mix it. Whereas,
    if there’re many outliers in data, it just sucks. But it is robust to missing
    values just like Random Forest because they both select subsets to fit.

    has more correlation with errors than $x_{j}$ has. Hence, the model increases
    $(\beta_{j},\beta_{k})$ in their joint least squares direction until $x_{m}$ has
    more correlation with errors. Thus, the model increases $(\beta_{j},\beta_{k},\beta_{m})$
    in their joint least squares direction. The model comes to its end until all samples
    in the model. Therefore, it can also settle samples’ autocorrelation in high dimension.
    OLS is the special case of LARS. When LARS doesn’t increase in joint least squares
    direction, the model becoms OLS. By the way, LARS is also powerful when $N\gg

    a knot. And each knot has a pair of basis functions. And these functions are used
    to describe the relationship between $x$ and $y$. The first basis function is
    $max(0,x-y)$. The second is $max(0,y-x)$.

- en: Bayesian Theorem [[27](#bib.bib27)]. For instance, we’re going to employ a model
    to distinguish whether a email is normal or spam. So what our model faces is that
    it has to make predictions about the unknown email. Our data has 100 emails and
    10% of them is spam. Hence, the percentage of spam is 10%. But that’s absolutely
    not the whole story. In Bayesian, it’s called Prior Probability, which means the
    Basic Assumption of the distribution and that’s where Bayesian Begins. At the
    beginning of the algorithm, Bayesian is biased in return the model is easily affected
    by the original distribution. For example, if we only have all 10 normal emails,
    it’s impossible that we wouldn’t get any spam emails in future. In other words,
    if the size of our data is quite small, it’s not incentive for us to implement
    Bayesian. However, when training times keep increasing, we should get ideal results
    ultimately. In the equation below, P(B) is a Normalization term and P(A) is Prior
    Probability. $P(A|B)$ is called Posterior Probability(Conditional Probability).
    To conclude, when we have much data, Bayesian may be a good choice to try while
    it exactly performs like other algorithms.

- en: Maximum Posterior Estimation [[29](#bib.bib29)]. Typically, we can use MAP(Maximum
    A Posterior Estimation) to replace MLE. It’s based on Bayesian Theorem. And MAP
    is fundamental to Bayesian Regression(equation 37). Rather than other standard
    algorithms, Bayesian Regression doesn’t produce a single value but a range of
    possible distribution. And in most cases, MLE and MAP are likely to get the same
    results. However, when the hypothesis of MAP is different from MLE, they fail
    to reach the same destination. When Prior Probability is uniformly distributed,
    they can make it. From another point of view, if we have some precise understanding
    of data, Bayesian Regression is a excellent choice in that it serves as Prior
    Probablity or we can weigh every different choice just like Weighted Least Errors.
    Interestingly, prior can be kind of Regularization or bias of the model, as such
    prior can be interpreted as L2 norm, which is also called Bayesian Ridge Regression.

    of different functions. And it consists of two significant parts. The first part
    is the probability distribution of $y$ such as normal distribution(OLS). The second
    is linear predictor, which decides how the coefficients combine with independent
    variables. And GLM includes several regression models such as Binomial Regression,
    Bernoulli Regression, Poisson Regression and so on. Their application is not so
    wide and they just swift the two parts compared to OLS. Hence, it’s left out in
    this paper.

    usage and availability of alternative models such as ensemble learning have led
    to calls to stop the use of this algorithm.

    and output layers. The input and output layers are independent vector and dependent
    vector. The pattern layer can be seen as a vector full of coefficients. For instance,
    if we want to apply $y=\theta x$. Then one pattern neuron stands for $\theta_{i}x_{i}$.
    And output layer can be formulated as the equation below. And this model can maintain
    its accuracy with small data and it’s robust to outliers. However, the structure
    of the network is complicated so that it is computationally expensive.

    Regression and Ordinal Regression have succeeded in using GRNN. And we can draw
    a safe conclusion that a complicated network structure can represent any kind
    of regression. But only few of them are proved successful. Neural Network is powerful
    and classic regression algorithms are well-structured. Maybe regression can be
    applied in neural network without missing its original function. Humans have made
    fundamental progress in Regression. If we can combine Regression with neural network
    perfectly, then it’s another picture.

- en: In this paper, I set out necessary assumptions with OLS and little tricks to
    fix the problems when assumptions are violated. Amazingly, it seems that OLS is
    the beginning of almost evey regression model. And a large number of Regression
    models are designed to be a better OLS. They can play their part in situations
    where OLS fails to work. I hold the belief that not evey algorithm needs to be
    introduced in details. Hence, the widespread algorithms are given enough attention
    and others are quickly illustrated. Finally, I give a quick overview of GRNN.
    From this paper, I can draw three conclusions.

    great ideas behind every classic algorithm is never out of date. And people always
    want to predict unknown values and regression task is really fascinating. Deep
    Learning is quite powerful. If regression can learn from Deep Learning and keeps
    its excellent part, I do believe regression can be more powerful in the near future.

    concerned, beautiful ideas behind every algorithm are shared. In other words,
    dipping into these old algorithms can enable us to gain insight and intuition
    about algorithms and put forward exciting algorithms which share the same ideas
    with regression algorithms and are just different implementations of awesome ideas
    to handle new problems.
