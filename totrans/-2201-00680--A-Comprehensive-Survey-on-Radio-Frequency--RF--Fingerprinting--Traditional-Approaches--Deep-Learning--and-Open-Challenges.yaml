- en: Fifth generation (5G) network and beyond envision massive Internet of Things
    (IoT) rollout to support disruptive applications such as extended reality (XR),
    augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), industrial automation, autonomous driving,
    and smart everything which brings together massive and diverse IoT devices occupying
    the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Along with the spectrum crunch and throughput
    challenges, such a massive scale of wireless devices exposes unprecedented threat
    surfaces. RF fingerprinting is heralded as a candidate technology that can be
    combined with cryptographic and zero-trust security measures to ensure data privacy,
    confidentiality, and integrity in wireless networks. Motivated by the relevance
    of this subject in the future communication networks, in this work, we present
    a comprehensive survey of RF fingerprinting approaches ranging from a traditional
    view to the most recent deep learning (DL)-based algorithms. Existing surveys
    have mostly focused on a constrained presentation of the wireless fingerprinting
    approaches, however, many aspects remain untold. In this work, however, we mitigate
    this by addressing every aspect - background on signal intelligence (SIGINT),
    applications, relevant DL algorithms, systematic literature review of RF fingerprinting
    techniques spanning the past two decades, discussion on datasets, and potential
    research avenues - necessary to elucidate this topic to the reader in an encyclopedic
    manner.

- en: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting - a form of signal intelligence - refers
    to the methodology whereby the hardware intrinsic characteristics of the transmitter
    which are unintentionally embedded in the transmitted waveform are extracted to
    aid the identification of the transmitter hardware by a passive receiver. Due
    to its unique ability to identify transmitting device, RF fingerprinting is envisioned
    as a key enabler for device authentication and access control to reduce the vulnerability
    of beyond 5G wireless networks to node forgery or insider attacks [[1](#bib.bib1)].

    (IoT) devices for smart home, industrial automation, smart metering, etc., the
    beyond 5G network is expected to support ultra-dense device connectivity which
    is $10\times$ that of 5G [[2](#bib.bib2)]. Moreover, with such overwhelming device
    density the threat surfaces of the network are bound to increase. Therefore, security
    and privacy are the crucial inevitable aspects beyond 5G (6G) will need to address.
    Especially the 6G enabling technologies such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output
    (UM-MIMO), visible light communication (VLC), terahertz (THz) communication, among
    others, introduce new realm of security challenges. Even in 5G networks, the OpenFlow
    implementation of the software defined network (SDN) makes it vulnerable to attacks
    from malicious applications. Further, the network function virtualization (NFV)
    presents security risks as the function is being migrated from one platform to
    another [[3](#bib.bib3)]. With the envisioned device density of the beyond 5G
    network, such vulnerabilities will only increase. The security threats can perhaps
    be best attributed to two causes; massive device density and diversity with respect
    to the applications as well as the hardware.

    unique to that device. RF fingerprinting is consequently viewed as the prospective
    enablers to address and mitigate the access control and device authentication
    challenges of the beyond 5G network. For the purpose of clarity, we define RF
    fingerprinting as a composite of three steps; feature identification, feature
    extraction, and device identification. It must be emphasized that these features
    are location-independent and ingrained to the chipset. Specifically, the imperfections
    in manufacturing the microcircuit parts such as power amplifiers, filters, clocks,
    etc., lead to broad variations in the phase offset, clock skew, among others.
    Another aspect that could serve as features are the vendor-specific implementations
    of wireless standards [[1](#bib.bib1)]. But such features could easily vary with
    firmware and software upgrades of the chipset. Clearly, the device-specific features
    would serve as a pronounced invariant feature set.

    scope. Specifically, a qualitative analysis of all RF signal intelligence aspects
    including AMC, wireless protocol recognition, and a quantitative discussion on
    key deep learning approaches have not been widely investigated to date in the
    current literature. In [[15](#bib.bib15)], the various techniques of identifying
    a mobile phone by fingerprinting the built-in components, such as camera, micro-electro-mechanical
    systems, speakers, microphone, and RF frontends have been discussed. In contrast,
    we attempt to cover all RF emitters such as software-defined radios (SDRs), unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other consumer-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices including
    mobile phones. The survey in [[16](#bib.bib16)] presents a short account of the
    RF fingerprint extraction and authentication methods with an emphasis on device
    authenticity - legal or illicit. Another survey in [[17](#bib.bib17)] reviews
    spoofer detection methods that leverages RF fingerprinting with special emphasis
    on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) emitters. Although this work presents
    a broader scope in contrast to [[15](#bib.bib15)] and [[16](#bib.bib16)], it lacks
    a thorough presentation of all aspects of RF signal intelligence. One other survey
    in [[18](#bib.bib18)] discusses the taxonomy of wireless device fingerprinting
    along with brief account on fingerprinting algorithms that are classical white-list
    and unsupervised learning-based. Our article goes beyond these works in providing
    the reader all aspects of RF signal intelligence including crossovers between
    traditional and deep learning based RF signal intelligence approaches. Unlike
    existing surveys which only provides a very brief (2-3 sentences) discussion on
    the reviewed articles, we dive into the reviewed works in the vast literature
    to provide a succinct excerpt on each. Further, the application scope of these
    signal intelligence techniques are not elaborated in any other existing surveys.
    The ultimate objective of this article is to provide an encyclopedic guide of
    RF fingerprinting that encompasses the basics of key supervised deep learning
    techniques as well as an extensive review of the state-of-the-art RF signal intelligence.

    focuses on extracting signal characteristics such as modulation, bandwidth, center
    frequency, protocols, emitter identity, among others from unknown RF signals in
    the spectrum of interest. This extraction can be performed under various levels
    of cooperation or prior knowledge based on the application at hand. The most challenging
    version is under the assumption of no prior information or cooperation which is

    the task performed. Perhaps the most popular and widely researched task is that
    of AMC and then wireless signal/protocol classification. One common theme between
    these classification tasks are the fact that the signals itself are evidently
    different from each other in these classification tasks making them a relatively
    easier task compared to RF fingerprinting where identical devices could be transmitting
    same waveform with identical configurations. Here for the benefit of the readers,
    we provide the background information of the two most common signal intelligence
    classes (AMC and signal type classification). This is also for the readers to

    likelihood-based methods [[19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20), [21](#bib.bib21),
    [22](#bib.bib22), [23](#bib.bib23), [24](#bib.bib24)] and (ii) feature-based [[25](#bib.bib25),
    [26](#bib.bib26), [27](#bib.bib27), [28](#bib.bib28)]. There have been several
    attempts to combine the two approaches to possibly extract the benefits of both
    approaches [[29](#bib.bib29)]. Likelihood-based approaches can provide optimal
    performance in the Bayesian sense but are often computationally demanding [[29](#bib.bib29),
    [30](#bib.bib30)]. On the other hand, feature-based classifiers can provide near
    optimal performance while being computationally efficient if carefully designed.
    Note here that the requirement of being “carefully designed" is perhaps the weakness
    of traditional feature-based approaches. It is often possible to design the classifier
    which performs extremely well under certain assumptions in simulations or laboratory
    settings but fail under real-world scenarios or when the operational environment
    changes. In other words, for AMC to be suitable for real-world approaches, it
    is important for the classifiers to generalize well to various operating scenarios
    and environments.'

- en: 'Neural network with expert-feature: Since the problem structure of feature-based
    classifiers are similar to the function approximation schema of the recently revitalized
    supervised machine learning, it was inevitable for these techniques to be leveraged
    for AMC. Consequently, in recent years, different machine learning techniques
    have been employed to determine the modulation format of the unknown signal via
    classification. During the initial stages of applying supervised learning for
    AMC, feature-engineered methodology was adopted as opposed to utilizing raw in-phase
    and quadrature (IQ) samples. This includes the use of support vector machines
    (SVMs) [[31](#bib.bib31)] and ANNs [[32](#bib.bib32), [33](#bib.bib33), [6](#bib.bib6)].
    In [[32](#bib.bib32)], the authors perform a twelve-class modulation classification
    with high accuracy over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values using
    a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In [[33](#bib.bib33)], the authors evaluate two
    different ANN architectures trained by the backpropagation method using the standard
    gradient descent (GD) learning algorithm by using six features. Similarly, [[6](#bib.bib6)]
    achieves high accuracy under low SNR conditions in identifying eight modulation
    schemes. All these studies are limited to simulations and not evaluated on actual
    hardware. In [[30](#bib.bib30)], authors elaborate the confronted challenges while
    transitioning their solution from simulation to hardware implementation. In short,
    due to the assumptions and unanticipated signal distortions that are overlooked
    during simulations, over-the-air performance of AMC techniques may experience
    degradation in real deployment.'

    (CNNs) in contrast to ANNs led to several works leveraging CNNs for modulation

    [36](#bib.bib36), [37](#bib.bib37), [9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)]. The authors

    and AlexNet [[39](#bib.bib39)] architectures - in predicting modulation formats
    on a dataset comprising eight classes by feeding constellation images as input.
    However, the models demonstrated sensitivity to image preprocessing factors such
    as image resolution, cropping size, selected area, etc., and achieved an accuracy
    below 80% at 0 dB SNR. We profess and attribute that this could be due to the
    adoption of heavy architectures suited for computer vision problems rather than
    for the RF application. A feed-forward feature-based neural network [[40](#bib.bib40)]
    was shown to achieve a classification accuracy of 98% on seven modulations on
    a USRP software-defined radio testbed. Time-frequency images were used as input
    for a CNN architecture to identify seven radar waveform classes in [[41](#bib.bib41)].
    Along a similar trend, cyclic spectrum images were used as CNN input to obtain
    a seven-class modulation recognition accuracy of 95% at SNRs above 2 dB in [[35](#bib.bib35)].

    method which involves identifying the wireless standard with which the RF waveform

    by performing a 15-class identification comprising three wireless standards -
    IEEE 802.11 b/g, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.15.1 - occupying different frequency
    channels. In a similar sense, [[10](#bib.bib10)] adopted a CNN architecture to
    address the spectrum crunch in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band
    by classifying seven classes belonging to Zigbee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and their cross-interferences.
    However, the model required operation in a high SNR regime for a 93% accuracy.
    In [[42](#bib.bib42)], the authors use a distance-based support vector data description
    (SVDD) algorithm to recognize low, slow, and small unmanned aerial vehicles (LSSUAVs)
    among the signals in the 2.4 GHz band by generating a hash fingerprint. The proposed
    method recognized LSSUAV signals without any mistakes and falsely recognized IEEE
    802.11b and IEEE802.11n signals as LSSUAV $13.5\%$ and $0\%$ of the time respectively
    in an indoor environment. Similarly, the authors [[43](#bib.bib43)] investigate
    recognition of UAV video signals in the presence of WiFi interference. Using random
    forest classifier, the authors show that the method can recognize UAV video signal
    in presence of WiFi interference with an accuracy of $100\%$ indoors and $96.26\%$
    when the UAV is 2 km from the receiver. In [[7](#bib.bib7)], the authors implement
    a CNN model to identify the presence of radar signals in the radio spectrum with
    interference from LTE and WLAN signals. The authors achieve a classification accuracy
    of $99.6\%$ while using amplitude and phase shift components of the signals in
    the dataset. The authors in [[44](#bib.bib44)] train CNN classifiers using time
    domain features to recognize WiFi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth devices operating in
    the 2.4 GHz band. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable
    of recognizing with an accuracy $\geq 95\%$ for SNR greater then 5 dB.

    both radar and communication waveforms to address the diverse and heterogeneous
    signal types encountered in practical deployment. Here, the authors train a CNN
    to perform two related tasks based on a single raw IQ input. The two tasks are
    assigned weights to formulate the weighted sum loss function and the model was
    trained with backpropagation. The authors emphasize the significance of designing
    lightweight models from the inception and provide real-world experimental evaluation
    with over-the-air collected waveforms under varying signal strengths. The evaluations
    demonstrated high-speed inferences The lightweight MTL performs faster inferences
    at the rate of 8.4 ms on an Intel Core i5-3230M CPU, consuming up to 90.5% lesser
    memory requirement in contrast to the benchmark. Further, the model was further
    compressed by performing INT8 quantization to showcase the computational savings
    for resource-constrained edge deployment platforms. The uncompressed 32-bit floating

    Alice may transmit a message to Bob using cryptography checksum which is a function
    of the message and the secret key. Bob can use the function and key to verify
    the authenticity of Alice while an intruder who tried to modify the message of
    the function will not be authenticated unless the secret key has been compromised.
    While this is not the sole method used in the industry for authentication, it
    is a typical representative example to demonstrate that the traditional authentication
    approach is active, i.e., it involves control message exchange and depends on
    secret keys. As one can imagine this leads to increased overhead due to the active
    nature of the authentication process. While secret keys are used for authentication
    process, it is still a point of vulnerability that could be compromised allowing
    illegitimate users gaining access to the network. Since the RF fingerprinting
    is hardware-specific and often unintentional characterization imparted at the
    analog component level, it is hard to mimic. Therefore, it could be argued that
    RF fingerprinting could be incorporated into more robust identification and authentication
    [[49](#bib.bib49)]. We explore the vulnerabilities of RF fingerprinting in section

    or integrated with other applications such as assisting with outdoor or indoor
    localization, navigation, and even tracking of specific verified emitters. This
    could be highly beneficial for tactical applications, law enforcement, and first
    responders. For example, in search and rescue applications victims or rescue operators
    could be uniquely tracked based on the unique RF fingerprint emitted by their
    devices. There are several other examples of applications where such tracking
    can be highly beneficial. For example, there has been interest from the National
    Institute of Justice in using RF fingerprinting for contraband wireless devices
    tracking in correctional facilities [[50](#bib.bib50)]. Similarly, in most cases,
    it is useful to track the warfighters during the mission to monitor their progress,
    instantaneous location, and provide assistance when required. First responders
    often encounter tough situations but in most cases rely on wireless communication
    devices. Thus, if these communication signals can be used to identify and track
    the first responders, it can greatly enhance the efficiency and safety of these
    operations.

    packets need to be emitted to help with the tracking since it can be done implicitly
    by overhearing the communication signals. This could decrease the overall overhead
    required for command and control of such operations. This technology like many
    others is a double-edged sword, one could imagine security vulnerabilities where
    modern devices could be identified by illegitimate entities and then used to track
    leading to privacy and security concerns. This implies there is a whole new emerging
    area of research and analysis that may aim at mitigating such security vulnerabilities.

    misuse of RF fingerprinting but at the same time, it is a powerful tool to detect
    intrusions and/or imitation attacks. With the proliferation of wireless devices
    ranging from 5G mobile devices to low-cost IoT devices, it is becoming difficult
    to secure the ever-expanding threat surfaces. While there are millions of devices
    they all depend on a few wireless protocols or standards such as 5G, WiFi, BLE,
    LoRa, among others essentially implying that there will also be several devices
    that transmit the same kind of signals. Therefore, it is becoming imperative to
    have the ability to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate users on-the-fly
    even if they transmit the same signals. More importantly, intruders often mimic
    or perform replay attacks. Just like traditional fingerprints enable some of the
    security systems to detect intruders, RF fingerprinting can serve the same purpose
    for commercial and tactical applications. For example, before a squadron is deployed
    into a mission, each of them could have RF fingerprint information of their fellow
    warfighters. In this way, each device will be able to alert the presence of an
    intruder who is not part of the signature database. There are many commercial
    buildings where unauthorized wireless devices are prohibited, in such commercial
    secure environments, the security officers could deploy a similar methodology
    where every approved device is registered using their RF fingerprint. Once the
    system is activated, the intruder detection system will be able to alert the operator
    of unauthorized transmission even if they resort to replay or imitation attacks.

    This approach is based on the concept of radiometric identity - taking advantage
    of minor variations of transmitter hardware leading to peculiar features in the
    transmitted signal - to identify the origin. The authors demonstrate the accuracy
    of PARADIS to be greater than $99\%$ for classifying more than $130$ 802.11 Network
    interface cards (NICs). The system quantifies the transmitter’s radiometric identity
    by comparing the signal with an ideal signal in the modulation domain on a frame-by-frame
    basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Modulation domain metrics such as frequency error, SYNC correlation, IQ offset,
    magnitude error, and phase error are used as the features for determining the
    radiometric identity of the device. The features resulting from hardware imperfections
    will be apparent over multiple frames. Therefore, calculating the statistical
    averages of these variations over multiple frames will magnify the artifacts caused
    by the hardware while at the same time reducing the effects of noise and channel.
    Following this, these five modulation domain metrics are classified using a classifier
    to identify the source. Two radiometric signature classifiers are implemented
    and evaluated, one using the SVM algorithm and the other using the k-nearest neighbors
    (k-NN) algorithm. The SVM classifier is built using LIBSVM [[66](#bib.bib66)],
    the model takes a single radiometric signature as input and outputs the most likely
    identity of the source with the measure of confidence. A k-NN classifier is implemented
    using a group of rankers, where each NIC has one ranker that calculates the similarity
    between a given signal and the template of its signature computed during training.

    of the signals is computed by first detecting the start point and extracting the
    transient of the signals using a variance-based threshold detection algorithm
    [[70](#bib.bib70)]. The relative difference between the adjacent FFT spectra is
    determined by applying a 1-D Fourier Transform on the transients. Following which
    the Fisher feature vector that forms the feature template is extracted using a
    Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) matrix. The LDA matrix is derived by a standard
    procedure based on scatter matrices [[82](#bib.bib82)]. Lastly, the fingerprint
    is matched by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between the reference and test

    multipath propagation, and voltage changes. But a change in the polarization of
    the signal alters the shape of the transient perturbing the frequency information
    present in the transient consequently leading to a drop in recognition accuracy.
    They also investigate the practicality of the system on attacks such as hill-climbing
    and DoS. Hill-climbing attack is a common impersonation attack where the attacker
    repeatedly submits data to the algorithm with slight modification. Modifications
    that improve or preserve the matching score are preserved. Over time, the attacker
    can achieve a score higher than the designed threshold resulting in a successful
    impersonation. The system can be vulnerable to an impersonation attack when the
    number of signals used to build the fingerprint feature template is low. This
    work investigates the vulnerability of the system to jamming-based DoS attacks.
    Due to the superposition of the original and the jamming signals, the system is
    unable to recognize the device. The authors suggest that this type of attack can
    be used as a security measure against an attacker.

    SNR $<20$ dB with a performance gain of approximately 2 dB relative to 27-feature
    TD fingerprinting. This increase in performance, given equal dimensionality, suggests
    that the classifier exploits the additional information present in DT-CWT features.

- en: A Multi-Fingerprint and Multi-Classifier Fusion (MFMCF) localization method
    for RF fingerprinting is proposed in [[95](#bib.bib95)]. The proposed technique
    aims to increase the localization accuracy of WiFi Access Points (APs) by constructing
    composite fingerprints and combining multiple classifiers. The authors construct
    a composite fingerprint set (CFS) consisting of received signal strength (RSS),
    signal strength difference (SSD), and hyperbolic location fingerprint (HLF) features.
    In this method, a decision structure with three classifiers k-NN, SVM, and random
    forest is used to obtain a more accurate location estimate.

    each at least 1.2 meters apart. A total of 100 RSS data is recorded for each of
    the APs at each location. Grubbs method [[97](#bib.bib97)] based on the mean and
    standard deviation is used to detect outliers in RSS data. The outliers are replaced
    with a Gaussian random number generated using the mean and variance of the non-abnormal
    data. SSD and HLF fingerprints are constructed based on the collected RSS. SSD
    is the difference in RSS values observed by two APs, and HLF is the ratio of RSS
    between pairs of APs. The three fingerprints, RSS, SSD, and HLF are combined to
    form the CFS. Linear discriminant analysis is used to reduce the dimensions of
    CFS. Using the reduced CFS, the three classifiers (K-NN, SVM, and random forest)
    are trained. In the testing stage, the entropy of each of the classifiers is calculated
    and the classifier with the least entropy is used to estimate the location.

    from 49 features in CFS, which covers more than $95\%$ of the information. The
    probability of zero positioning error of MFMCF is $96.5\%$, which is an increase
    of $4.2\%$, $6.4\%$, and $7.7\%$ compared with RSS, SDD, and HLS, respectively,
    when used as independent fingerprint features for classification. To compare MFMCF
    with independent classifiers, CFS was used to train and test individual classifiers.
    The probability of zero positioning errors of MFMCF, RF, k-NN, and SVM were $96.5\%$,
    $90.2\%$, $92.9\%$, and $94.8\%$, respectively. The authors also show that the

    an accuracy of $24\%$ to $30\%$ higher than the classifier trained with just statistical

- en: Convolutional networks or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specialized
    type of feedforward neural network known for its spatial mapping capability. A
    CNN performs convolution operation in at least one of its layers. The *feature
    extraction* capability of CNNs mimics the neural activity of the animal visual
    cortex [[100](#bib.bib100)]. The convolution operation in CNNs emulates the scene
    perception characteristic of the brain’s visual cortex whereby they are sensitive
    to sub-regions of the perceived scene. Accordingly, CNNs have been widely used
    for computer vision problems [[101](#bib.bib101), [39](#bib.bib39), [102](#bib.bib102),
    [103](#bib.bib103), [104](#bib.bib104), [105](#bib.bib105), [106](#bib.bib106),
    [107](#bib.bib107), [108](#bib.bib108)]. The convolution is an efficient method
    of feature extraction that reduces the data dimension and consequently reduces
    the parameters of the network. Therefore, in contrast to its fully connected feedforward
    counterpart, CNNs are more efficient and easier to train.

    The convolution layer convolve the input tensor $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{W\times
    H\times D}$ of width $W$, height $H$, and depth $D$ with the kernel (filter) $\mathbf{F}\in\mathbb{R}^{w\times
    h\times D}$ of width $w$, height $h$, and of the same depth as the input tensor
    to generate an output feature map $\mathbf{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{W_{1}\times H_{1}\times
    D_{1}}$. The dimension of the feature map is a function of the input as well as
    kernel dimensions, the number of kernels $N$, stride $S$, and the amount of zero
    padding $P$. Likewise, the feature map dimensions can be derived as $W_{1}=\left(W-w+2P\right)/S+1,\;H_{1}=\left(H-h+2P\right)/S+1,\;D_{1}=N$.
    In other words, there will be as many feature maps as the number of kernels. Kernel
    refers to the set of weights and biases. The kernel operates on the input slice
    in a sliding window manner based on the stride - the number of steps with which
    to slide the kernel along with the input slice. Hence, each depth slice of the
    input is treated with the same kernel or in other words, shares the same weights
    and biases - *parameter sharing*. A feature map illustration from a convolution
    operation on an input slice $\mathbf{x}$ by a kernel $\mathbf{f}$ is demonstrated

    alleviate it. While this may work in a setting where one can make such impairments
    to the transmit chain, in many commercial and tactical applications this is not
    an option at the physical layer. It can be further argued at that point one is
    not exactly exploiting the "unique" RF fingerprint of the device but rather assigning
    the device an artificial tag/id/fingerprint. This is certainly an interesting

    signals from 7 identical DJI M100 UAVs using an USRP X310 equipped with a UBX
    160 daughterboard in an RF anechoic chamber. The IQ signals are captured by flying
    the UAVs at a distance of 6, 9, 12, and 15 feet from the receiver. They collect
    four bursts of  2 seconds, each burst containing $\sim$140 data sequences (examples)
    for all the UAVs at the four different distances individually. The authors use
    1D modified versions of AlexNet (AlexNet1D) and ResNet50 (ResNet1D) neural network
    architectures for classification. AlexNet1D is a forward CNN with five blocks
    (consisting of two 1D convolutional layers with 128 filters of sizes 7 and 5 respectively,

    accuracy of DL-based RF fingerprinting. When the network is trained with all 4
    bursts of the UAVs dataset, the network performs well in identifying the UAVs.
    But when the network is trained using the first three bursts and tested on burst
    4, both the network architectures perform with an accuracy of  $50\%$. This drop
    in accuracy shows the effect of continuous channel variation and minute UAV movements
    when hovering. To overcome this effect, the authors propose a multi-classifier
    scheme in which the burst signals from the dataset are partitioned to form non-overlapping
    sets and each of these partitions is used as training sets for identical but independent
    AlexNet1D Neural Networks. The outputs of the neural networks are then combined
    using a two-level score-based aggregation method. They also propose an algorithm
    for determining the number of neural networks to be used in the multi-classifier
    scheme. To evaluate the proposed method, the authors choose to use 12 neural networks.
    The proposed multi-classifier technique improves the classification accuracy from
    $50\%$ when using a single classifier to $91\%$ when the network is trained using
    the first three bursts and tested using the fourth burst.

    [[117](#bib.bib117)]. In this work, DA is performed by normalizing the training
    batch according to the mean and standard deviation of the whole dataset. The normalized
    dataset is then passed through the DA block where it is convolved with a block
    of multi-tap complex FIR filters. The use of DA improved the accuracy of the multi-classifier
    technique by up to $95\%$. This work also proposes a method for detecting new
    UAVs (UAVs not included in the training dataset). Using the proposed multi-classifier
    with a data augmentation scheme, the authors show an accuracy of $99\%$ in detecting
    new UAVs. The authors clearly state that the improvement in the accuracy when
    using the multi-classifier approach comes with no increase in model size compared
    to single ResNet1D architecture but at the cost of a longer testing/training process.
    However, one can claim that the data capture in an anechoic chamber eliminates
    the rich multipath propagation effects as in the real-world settings.

    signals from 54 Texas Instruments CC2530 ZigBee modules using a USRP. The DCTF
    is computed for each of the signals and classified using a network consisting
    of three convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. The three convolutional
    layers are of sizes 16, 32, and 64, respectively, with a kernel size of $3\times

    multiple bursts of the signal from the same but unknown device (i.e., sharing
    same label) to drive the noise level down. The inference is performed on multiple
    bursts and the class probability vectors from the inference on each bursts are
    combined to derive a final class prediction. The authors report a prediction accuracy
    in upwards of 95% across different signal types (WiFi and ADS-B).

    transmitters is implemented using generative adversarial nets (GANs). The authors
    also implement a CNN and DNN based classifier that exploits the IQ imbalance present
    in the received signal to learn the unique fingerprint features for classifying
    the devices. The dataset used in this work consists of QPSK modulation signals
    from eight USRP B210s received using an RTL-SDR and are considered as signals
    from trusted transmitters. With the help of an adversary, the generator model
    generates random signals with noise and is passed to the discriminative model
    as input. The discriminative models of the GANs take input from both the generator
    model and trusted transmitters and improve the random signal to imitate the real
    data by giving feedback to the generator model for tuning the hyperparameters.
    The generator model network consists of two fully connected layers with 512 and
    1024 nodes, and the discriminative model network is made of three fully connected
    layers with 1024, 512, and 2 nodes with dropout layers between the first two fully

    M100 UAVs in an RF anechoic chamber. Signals are captured using an USRP X310 with
    UBX 160 USRP daughterboard. The receiver is tuned to the 10 MHz of downlink channel
    centered at 2.4065 GHz. The signals are captured by flying the UAVs individually
    at distances of 6, 9, 12, and 15 ft from the receiver. Each capture consists of
    4 cycles of recording IQ samples for $\sim 2$ seconds and pausing for $\sim 10$
    seconds, resulting in 4 non-overlapping bursts with $\sim 140$ interleaved short
    periods of data and noise in each burst. Accordingly, with a total of 7 UAVs where
    each are flew at 4 distances with 4 bursts (each of $\sim$ 140 examples) at each
    distance, the dataset provides over 13k examples of $\sim$ 92k IQ samples per
    example. The dataset is in SigMF format with data of each capture stored in binary
    format accompanied by a JSON file with the metadata of the capture.

    GNU Radio. Four datasets are created with three different channel conditions and
    two different environments. Dataset "Setup 1" consists of signals captured from
    20 transmitting SDRs with each transmitter using a dedicated Ettus VERT2450 antenna
    and varying distance from the receiver. The dataset collection process is repeated
    on ten days. Dataset "Setup 2" is captured similarly to "Setup 1", but all the
    SDR use a common Ettus VERT2450 antenna making all 20 devices equidistant from
    the receiver. This leads to all transmissions experiencing similar channel and
    multi-path conditions. The dataset collection process is repeated on two different
    days. Dataset "Setup 3" is collected by capturing the WiFi signals from 20 transmitters
    using a single coaxial RF SMA cable and a 5 dB attenuator. Thereby, all signals
    experience the same channel conditions and eliminate any multipath conditions.
    The dataset collection process is repeated on two different days. Datasets "Setup

    Dataset "Setup 4" is collected similar to "Setup 2" but in an anechoic chamber

    unique distortions, the receiver hardware that captures and processes these emissions
    for fingerprinting can impact the fingerprinting approach. Specifically, the phase
    noise, clock offsets, filter distortions, IQ imbalance, etc., introduced by the
    receiver hardware could etch its own unique fingerprint to transform the transmitter
    fingerprint to appear as from a rogue or unidentified emitter. The ADC sampling
    rate as well as bandwidth of low pass filter (LPF) play an equally important role
    in retaining the fingerprint features that reside in the side lobes of the power
    spectrum density (PSD). Higher sampling rates were shown to retain the fingerprint
    features at a cost of increased noise using actual MicaZ sensors [[158](#bib.bib158)].
    Moreover, the effect of antenna polarization and orientation at the transmitter
    and receiver end can cause fluctuations in radiation pattern affecting the fingerprint
    extraction performance. The imperfection of emitter antenna hardware can also
    contribute to the fingerprint feature set enabling wireless emitter identification
    [[69](#bib.bib69)]. We argue here that the number of receiver antennas, type,
    their orientation, and polarization can impact the classification performance
    of the fingerprinting system.'

    captures from multiple receiver hardwares corresponding to an emitter in the dataset.
    Such a larger distribution of training data would allow the model to generalize
    and differentiate the emitter fingerprint from the recorded waveforms. The independence
    of fingerprinting algorithm can be assessed by training on samples captured by
    a particular receiver hardware and evaluating the learned emitter features by
    testing on samples from another receiver hardware.

- en: '*Vulnerabilities of RFFS*: The broadcast nature of wireless emitters renders
    them exposed and susceptible to identity spoofing. Few such attacks are DoS, impersonation,
    bandwidth theft, etc. It is often overlooked that passive receiver threats can
    build up their own dataset of emissions from specific transmitters to build cognitive
    RFFS. Developing or perturbing the emitter fingerprint such that it cannot be
    extracted by passive listeners while allowing only legit receivers to extract
    or identify the signature is another interesting research problem to enhance wireless
    security. Generally, it is assumed that RF fingerprinting is robust to impersonation
    attacks due to the difficulty in reproducing the frontend impairments with replay
    attacks since that will introduce the hardware defects of the replaying device.
    This area is pristine and the research here is limited currently. In literature,
    it was shown that transient-based RF fingerprinting is more resilient to impersonation
    attacks in contrast to modulation-based RF fingerprinting [[159](#bib.bib159)].
    Another work in [[160](#bib.bib160)] analyzed the effect of several low-end receivers
    (manufactured with inexpensive analog components) on the resilience of modulation-based
    RF fingerprinting to impersonation attacks. Their evaluation revealed that the
    RF fingerprint from a specific transmitter varies across the receivers. The receiver’s
    hardware imperfections as we have discussed above contributes to the fingerprint
    feature set. Further, they exploit this fact to thwart the impersonation attacks
    and state that the impersonator would not be able to extract the fingerprint features
    contributed by the receiver hardware, rendering an even robust RFFS. Another threat
    that can disrupt the RFFS are jamming DoS attacks whereby the intruder can continuously
    transmit in the operating frequency. This area will require more analysis to evaluate
    the resiliency of RFFS to such DoS attacks.'

    RF fingerprint of transmitters for covert and confidential operations. RF fingerprint
    obfuscation - such that the fingerprint can only be extracted by the legitimate
    receiver while remaining undetectable to others - was experimentally studied on
    WiFi signals in [[161](#bib.bib161)]. The authors achieve this by introducing
    randomized phase errors such that only the legitimate receivers with a preshared
    key and randomization index can decode the message as well as the fingerprint.

    to date (at the time of writing this article) has only looked at the problem of
    identifying emitter signature when only one emitter is active. An even challenging
    problem would be when multiple emitters are active, this is typical of a real-world
    setting. Such a scenario would require the fingerprinting algorithm to separately
    distinguish and extract the signatures of each emitters from the received signal
    clutter. Another challenge involved in studying such a scenario would be the availability
    of a dataset that incorporates multiple active emitters. Each emitter transmission
    creates its own propagation path from the transmitting antenna to the radio frontend
    of the receiver hardware. The effect of multipath propagation effects and location
    of the emitter relative to the receiver is enough to create a unique signature
    which would vary with location and wireless channel effects. These dynamic fading
    and location effects due to its inherent randomness could mask the *pure* emitter
    signature leading to false alarms and misclassification.'

    channel effects when the sensors were far apart than when they were in close proximity
    to the receiver. Equalization at the receiver that would compensate for the multipath
    effects without deteriorating the fingerprint features is still an open research
    problem.

    over the past two decades by first broadly classifying them into traditional and
    DL-based followed by dissecting each in a categorized manner. We first provided
    context to the reader by introducing and summarizing the three pillars of SIGINT
    - modulation recognition, protocol classification, and emitter identification.
    We present an invaluable and concise discussion on the diverse applications of
    RF fingerprinting to highlight the practical use cases of the subject under study.
    To elucidate and dilute the vast literature on traditional and DL-based fingerprinting
    approaches, we present a categorized and clear layout of each. We have also provided
    tabular comparative study of the reviewed works wherever applicable for summarizing
    in a straightforward manner. In order to equip the reader with the essential toolkit
    to delve into this topic, we reviewed the most relevant DL approaches in a tutorial
    manner prior to diving into the DL-based fingerprinting techniques. Since the
    knowledge of and access to openly available datasets are key to practice the reviewed
    approaches, we have provided an elaborate discussion on the most relevant RF fingerprinting
    datasets. Finally, in order to stimulate future research in this realm, we present
    a roadmap of potential research avenues in an illustrative manner.
