    technical reports, and GitHub repositories published over the last 10 years on
    the recent developments of deep learning techniques for iris recognition, covering
    broad topics on algorithm designs, open-source tools, open challenges, and emerging
    research. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of deep learning techniques
    developed for two main sub-tasks in iris biometrics: segmentation and recognition.
    Second, we focus on deep learning techniques for the robustness of iris recognition
    systems against presentation attacks and via human-machine pairing. Third, we
    delve deep into deep learning techniques for forensic application, especially
    in post-mortem iris recognition. Fourth, we review open-source resources and tools
    in deep learning techniques for iris recognition. Finally, we highlight the technical
    challenges, emerging research trends, and outlook for the future of deep learning
    in iris recognition.'

- en: The human iris is a sight organ that controls the amount of light reaching the
    retina, by changing the size of the pupil. The texture of the iris is fully developed
    before birth, its minutiae do not depend on genotype, it stays relatively stable
    across lifetime (except for disease- and normal aging-related biological changes),
    and it may even be used for forensic identification shortly after subject’s death (Muron
    and Pospisil, [2000](#bib.bib111); Daugman, [2016](#bib.bib37); Trokielewicz et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib171)).

- en: 'In terms of its information theory-related properties, the iris texture has
    an extremely high randotypic randomness, and is stable (permanent) over time,
    providing an exceptionally high entropy per mm.² that justifies its higher discriminating
    power, when compared to other biometric modalities (e.g., face or fingerprint).
    The iris’ collectability is another feature of interest and has been the subject
    of discussion over the last years: while it can be acquired using commercial off-the-shelf
    (COTS) hardware, either handheld or stationary, data can be even collected from
    at-a-distance, up to tens of meters away from the subjects (Nguyen et al., [2017a](#bib.bib112)).
    Even though commercial visible-light (RGB) cameras are able to image the iris,
    the near infrared-based (NIR) sensing dominates in most applications, due to a
    better visibility of iris texture for darker eyes, rich in melanin pigment, which
    is characterized by lower light absorption in NIR spectrum compared to shorter
    wavelengths. In addition, NIR wavelengths are barely perceivable by the human
    eye, which augment users’ comfort, and avoids pupil contraction/dilation that
    would appear under visible light.'

- en: A seminal work by John Daugman brought to the community the Gabor filtering-based
    approach that became the dominant approach for iris recognition (Daugman, [1993](#bib.bib35),
    [2007](#bib.bib36), [2021](#bib.bib38)). Even though subsequent solutions to iris
    image encoding and matching appeared, the IrisCodes approach is still dominant
    due to its ability to effectively search in massive databases with a minimal probability
    of false matches, at extreme time performance. By considering binary words, pairs
    of signatures are matched using XOR parallel-bit logic at lightening speed, enabling
    millions of comparisons/second per processing core. Also, most of the methods
    that outperformed the original techniques in terms of effectiveness do not work
    under the *one-shot learning* paradigm, assume multiple observations of each class
    to obtain appropriate decision boundaries, and - most importantly - have encoding/matching
    steps with time complexity that forbid their use in large environments (in particular,
    for *all-against-all* settings).

- en: In short, Daugman’s algorithm encodes the iris image into a binary sequence
    of 2,048 bits by filtering the iris image with a family of Gabor kernels. The
    varying pupil size is rectified by the Cartesian-to-polar coordinate system transformation,
    to end up with an image representation of canonical size, guarantying identical
    structure of the iris code independently of the iris and pupil size. This makes
    possible to use the Hamming Distance (HD) to measure the similarity between two
    iris codes (Daugman, [2021](#bib.bib38)). Its low false match rate at acceptable
    false non-match rates is the key factor behind the success of global-scale iris
    recognition installments, such as the national person identification and border
    security program Aadhaar program in India (with over 1.2 billion pairs of irises
    enrolled) (Unique Identification Authority of India, [2021](#bib.bib175)), the
    Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology (HART) in the US (up to 500 million identities)
    (Planet Biometrics, [2017](#bib.bib129)), or the NEXUS system, designed to speed
    up border crossings for low-risk and pre-approved travelers moving between Canada
    and the US.

    Network architectures, have been driving remarkable improvements in many computer
    vision applications over the last decade. In terms of biometrics technologies,
    it’s not surprising that iris recognition has also seen an increasing adoption
    of purely data-driven approaches at all stages of the recognition pipeline: from
    preprocessing (such as off-axis gaze correction), segmentation, encoding to matching.
    Interestingly, however, the impact of deep learning on the various stages of iris
    recognition pipeline is uneven. One of the primary goals of this survey paper
    is to assess where deep learning helped in achieving highly performance and more
    secure systems, and which procedures did not benefit from more complex modeling.'

    integro-differential operator (Daugman, [1993](#bib.bib35)) up to subsequent handcrafted
    techniques based in active contours and neural networks (e.g., (He et al., [2009](#bib.bib69)), (Proença,
    [2010](#bib.bib134)), (Shah and Ross, [2009](#bib.bib148)) and (Vatsa et al.,
    [2008](#bib.bib176))) a long road has been traveled in this problem. Regardless
    an obvious evolution in the effectiveness of such techniques, they all face particular
    difficulties in case of heavily degraded data. Images are frequently motion-blurred,
    poor focused, partially occluded and off-angle. Additionally, in case of visible
    light data, severe reflections from the environments surrounding the subjects
    are visible, and even augment the difficulties of the segmentation task.

- en: Schlett *et* al. (Schlett et al., [2018](#bib.bib145)) provided a multi-spectral
    analysis to improve iris segmentation accuracy in visible wavelengths by preprocessing
    data before the actual segmentation phase, extracting multiple spectral components
    in form of RGB color channels. Even though this approach does propose a DL-based
    framework, the different versions of the input could be easily used to feed DL-based
    models, and augment the robustness to non-ideal data. Chen *et* al. (Chen et al.,
    [2019a](#bib.bib23)) used CNNs that include dense blocks, referred to as a dense-fully
    convolutional network (DFCN), where the encoder part consists of dense blocks,
    and the decoder counterpart obtains the segmentation masks via transpose convolutions.
    Hofbauer *et* al. (Hofbauer et al., [2019](#bib.bib73)) parameterize the iris
    boundaries based on segmentation maps yielding from a CNN, using a a cascaded
    architecture with four RefineNet units, each directly connecting to one Residual
    net. Huynh *et* al. (Huynh et al., [2019](#bib.bib77)) discriminate between three
    distinct eye regions with a DL model, and removes incorrect areas with heuristic
    filters. The proposed architecture is based on the encoder-decoder model, with
    depth-wise convolutions used to reduce the computational cost. Roughly at the
    same time, Li *et* al. (Li et al., [2021](#bib.bib95)) described the *Interleaved
    Residual U-Net* model for semantic segmentation and iris mask synthesis. In this
    work, unsupervised techniques (K-means clustering) were used to create intermediary
    pictorial representations of the ocular region, from where saliency points deemed
    to belong to the iris boundaries were found. Kerrigan *et* al. (Kerrigan et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib86)) assessed the performance of four different convolutional architectures
    designed for semantic segmentation. Two of these models were based in dilated
    convolutions, as proposed by Yu and Koltun (Y. and K., [2016](#bib.bib189)). Wu
    and Zhao (Wu and Zhao, [2019](#bib.bib187)) described the Dense U-Net model, that
    combines dense layers to the U-Net network. The idea is to take advantage of the
    reduced set of parameters of the dense U-Net, while keeping the semantic segmentation
    capabilities of U-Net. The proposed model integrates dense connectivity into U-Net
    contraction and expansion paths. Compared with traditional CNNs, this model is
    claimed to reduce learning redundancy and enhance information flow, while keeping
    controlled the number of parameters of the model. Wei *et* al. (Zhang et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib206)) suggested to perform *dilated convolutions*, which is claimed
    to obtain more consistent global features. In this setting, convolutional kernels
    are not continuous, with zero-values being artificially inserted between each
    non-zero position, increasing the receptive field without augmenting the number
    of parameters of the model.

    segmented data (Proença and Neves, [2017](#bib.bib133))(Proença and Neves, [2019](#bib.bib136)).

    Another benefit is that there is no need for large scale iris image datasets to
    train these networks because they have already been trained on such large-scale

    of softmax-based losses to classify an iris image into a list of known identities.
    Coupling a softmax loss with a backbone network enables training the backbone
    network in an end-to-end manner via popular optimization strategies such as back-propagation
    and steepest gradient decent. Compared to the conventional classifier approaches,
    the DL-based backbones in this category are learnable directly from the iris data,
    allowing them to better represent the iris. The key benefit is that it is similar
    to a generic image classification task, hence all designs and algorithms in the
    generic image classification task can be trivially applied with the iris image
    data. Typical examples of these iris classification networks are (Gangwar and
    Joshi, [2016](#bib.bib57); Boyd et al., [2019](#bib.bib16)). However, these softmax-based
    networks require the iris in the test image be known in the identity classes in
    the training set, which means the networks must be re-trained whenever a new class
    (*i.e.* a new identity) is added. Gangwar *et al.* proposed two backbone networks
    (*i.e.* DeepIrisNet-A and DeepIrisNet-B) followed by a softmax loss for the iris
    recognition task (Gangwar and Joshi, [2016](#bib.bib57)). Later, they proposed
    another backbone network, but still followed by a softmax loss to classify one
    normalized iris image into a pre-defined list of identity (Gangwar et al., [2019](#bib.bib58)).

    of well-known handcrafted features such as IrisCode (Daugman, [2007](#bib.bib36))
    transformed iris texture image into a complex-valued representation first, then
    further encoded the complex-valued representation to get a final representation.
    They proposed to use fully complex-valued networks rather than popular real-valued
    networks. Complex-valued backbone networks better retain the phase, are more invariant
    to multi-scale, multi-resolution and multi-orientation, have solid correspondence
    with the classic Gabor wavelets (Tygert et al., [2016](#bib.bib174)), hence are
    much better suited to iris recognition than their real-valued counterparts.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In parallel to the popularity of biometrics, the security of these systems against
    attacks has become of paramount importance. The most common attack is a Presentation
    Attack (PA), which refers to presenting a fake sample to the sensor. The goal
    can be either to impersonate somebody else identity (also known as Impostor Attack
    Presentation), or to conceal the own identity (also known as Concealer Attack
    Presentation). Via impostor attacks, a person could also enroll fraudulently,
    allowing a continuous manipulation of the system. The previous acronyms and terms
    in italics correspond to the vocabulary recommended in the series of ISO/IEC 30107
    standards of the ISO/IEC Subcommittee 37 (SC37) on Biometrics (technology — Biometric
    presentation attack detection — Part 1: Framework, [2016](#bib.bib164)), which
    we will follow in the rest of this section. Presentation Attack Instruments (PAI)
    used to carry out impostor attacks are typically generated from bona fide images
    of an iris from an individual who has legitimate access to the system. The iris
    is printed on a piece of paper (printout attack) or displayed on a screen (replay
    attack) and then presented to the sensor. The iris of deceased individuals can
    also be used as PAI, since the texture remains intact for some hours (Trokielewicz
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib170)). Theoretically, it would be possible to print a genuine
    iris texture into a contact lens as well, although this has not been successfully
    demonstrated yet (Boyd et al., [2020a](#bib.bib17)). Concealer attacks, on the
    other hand, are commonly done via textured contact lenses that obscure or alter
    properties of the eye (such as color) to prevent the system from identifying the
    user. Synthetic iris images (Yadav et al., [2019a](#bib.bib192)) not belonging
    to any specific identity could be used for similar purposes. Concealers can also
    present their legitimate iris, but in a way not expected by the system, e.g. closing
    eyelids as much as possible, looking to the sides (off-axis gaze), rotating the
    head, etc.

    system, and they do not require specific knowledge of its inner workings, or any
    technical knowledge at all. Thus, if no properly tackled, they can derail public
    perception of even the most reliable biometric modality. It is even more critical
    if authentication is done without any supervision. Presentation Attack Detection
    (PAD) methods to counteract such attacks can be done (Galbally and Gomez-Barrero,
    [2016](#bib.bib55)): $i$) at the hardware (or sensor) level, using additional
    illuminators or sensors that detect intrinsic properties of a living eye or responses
    to external stimuli (like pupil contraction or reflection), or $ii$) at the software
    level, using only the footprint of the PA (if any) left in the same images captured
    with the standard sensor that will be employed for authentication. Software-based
    techniques are in principle less expensive and intrusive, since they do not demand
    extra hardware, and they will be the focus of this section.'

    (2018) and (Boyd et al., [2020a](#bib.bib17)) (2020). While DL techniques were
    residual in the 2018 survey, they rose in popularity thereafter. We build this
    section upon the latest survey and summarize the most important developments in
    DL-PAD since it was published (Table [3](#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‣ 4.5\. Open Research
    Questions in Iris PAD ‣ 4\. Deep Learning-Based Iris Presentation Attack Detection
    ‣ Deep Learning for Iris Recognition: A Survey")). A descriptive summary of the
    datasets employed is given later in Section [8](#S8 "8\. Open-Source Deep Learning-Based
    Iris Recognition Tools ‣ Deep Learning for Iris Recognition: A Survey"). The aim
    of PAD is to classify an image either as a bona fide or an attack presentation,
    so it is usually modeled as a two-class classification task. Typical strategies
    mimic the trend of the previous section when applying DL to iris recognition:
    either a CNN backbone is used to extract features that will feed a conventional
    classifier, or the network is trained end-to-end to do the classification itself.
    Some hybrid methods also combine traditional hand-crafted with deep-learned features.
    In the same manner, the network may be initialized e.g. on the ImageNet dataset
    to take advantage of such large generic corpus, since available iris PAD data
    is more scarce. Another strategy also employed widely in the PAD literature is
    to use adversarial networks, where a GAN (Goodfellow et al., [2014](#bib.bib61))
    is trained to generate synthetic iris images that the discriminator must use to
    detect attack samples.'

    the division of the normalized iris image into overlapped micro-stripes which

    are that the classifier is forced to focus on the iris/sclera boundaries (given

    of samples is higher (reducing overfitting), and the impact of imprecise segmentation

    The outputs were then fused via element-wise sum to capture complementary attention
    features from both channel and spatial dimensions. With three datasets containing
    colored contact lenses, artificial eyes (Van Dyke/Doll fake eyes), printouts,
    and textured contact lenses, the attention modules are shown to improve accuracy
    over the baseline network. Using heatmap visualization, it is also shown that
    the attention modules force the network to attend to the annular iris textural
    region which, intuitively, plays a vital role for PAD.

    on a particular dataset or CNN. They also explored the selection of augmentation
    techniques, finding, again, no consensus regarding the best combination, which

    Cosmetic lenses also appear to be more difficult to detect than artificial eyes

    with an image. This is different than previous works of the same authors (Yadav
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib193), [2019a](#bib.bib192)) which employed the traditional
    generator/discriminator approach driven by a noise vector. Different PAD methods
    using hand-crafted (BSIF, DESIST) and deep features (VGG16, D-NetPAD, AlexNet)
    were evaluated, demonstrating that they can be improved by adding synthetically
    generated data. The quality of synthetic images is also superior to a competing
    generative method (Star-GAN v2), measured via FID score distributions.

- en: One of the open research issues is to design robust iris PAD methods with cross-sensor
    and cross-database capabilities, so they generalize to unseen imaging conditions.
    Attackers are constantly developing new attack methodologies to circumvent PAD
    systems, so an even more important issue is unseen PAIs (i.e. cross-PAI capabilities)
    (Sharma and Selwal, [2021](#bib.bib150)). Great results have been achieved on
    detecting known attack types (known as closed-set recognition), although cross-database
    evaluation (training in one database an testing in others) still appears as a
    difficult challenge due to changes in sensors, acquisition environments, or subjects.
    Moreover, generalizing to attacks that are unknown at the time of training (open-set
    recognition) is even a greater challenge for state-of-the-art methods (Fang et al.,
    [2021b](#bib.bib46)). Part of the problem lies into the limited size of existing
    databases, which is an issue for data-hungry DL approaches. Some solutions, as
    studied by some of the methods above, are data augmentation by geometric or illumination
    modifications (Fang et al., [2021d](#bib.bib48)), or creating additional synthetic
    data via generative methods (Yadav and Ross, [2021](#bib.bib194)). Human-aided
    DL training is another promising avenue. Indeed, humans and machines cooperating
    in vision tasks is not new, and this strategy is finding its way into DL as well
    (Boyd et al., [2021](#bib.bib18), [2022](#bib.bib15)). For example, Boyd et al.
    (Boyd et al., [2022](#bib.bib15)) analyzed the utility of human judgement about
    salient regions of images to improve generalization of DL models. Asked about
    regions that humans deem important for their decision about an image, the work
    proposed to transform the training data to incorporate such opinions, demonstrating
    an improvement in accuracy and generalization in leave-one-attack-type-out scenarios.
    In a similar work, Boyd et al. (Boyd et al., [2021](#bib.bib18)) incorporated
    annotated saliency maps into the loss function to penalize large differences with
    human judgement.

    to discriminatory performance differences based on the user´s demographics, with
    face biometrics being the most talked-about and many companies and authorities
    banning its use (Jain et al., [2021](#bib.bib79)). Obviously, this issue appears
    in iris PAD as well, as addressed by Fang et al. (Fang et al., [2021e](#bib.bib50)).
    Using three baselines based on hand-crafted and DL approaches and a database of
    contact lenses, the authors showed a significant difference in the performance
    between male and female samples. In dealing with this phenomenon, examination
    of biases towards eye color or race are another directions worthwhile to consider.

    be worn normally by users without the purpose of fooling the biometric system,
    as it is the case of facial retouching via make-up, digital beautification or
    augmented reality (Hedman et al., [2021](#bib.bib70)). This poses the question
    of whether it is possible to use such images for authentication, while diminishing
    the effect in the recognition performance. Suggested alternatives have been to
    detect and match portions of live iris tissue still visible (Parzianello and Czajka,
    [2022](#bib.bib126)) or incorporate ocular information of the surrounding area
    (Alonso-Fernandez and Bigun, [2016](#bib.bib5)). Unfortunately, in iris biometrics,
    recognition with textured contact lenses remains a hard problem to solve.

    significantly from live iris images and rarely meet ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality requirements,
    as shown in Fig. [3](#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5\. Deep Learning-Based Forensic Iris
    Recognition ‣ Deep Learning for Iris Recognition: A Survey")(a). The challenges
    are related to appropriate detection of places when cornea dries and generates
    irregular and large specular highlights, as well regions where iris muscle furrows
    show up when the eyeball dehydrates. This is where DL-based methods may win over
    hand crafted approaches, as the latter usually make strong assumptions about anatomy
    of the iris appearance, not possible to be predicted for eyes undergoing random
    decomposition processes. Trokielewicz et al. proposed the first known to us iris
    recognition method designed specifically to cadaver irises (Trokielewicz et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib172), [2020](#bib.bib173)). It incorporates SegNet-based segmenter
    and Siamese networks-based feature extractor, both trained in a domain-specific
    way solely on post-mortem iris samples. An interesting element of this approach
    is that segmetation incorporates two models: one trained with “fine” ground truth
    masks, marking all details associated with eye decomposition, and “coarse” model,
    aiming at detecting iris annulus and eyelids, as in classical iris recognition
    approaches. This allowed to apply a standard “rubber sheet” iris images normalization
    based on “coarse” masks, and at the same time exclude decomposition-driven artifacts
    from encoding, marked by the “fine” mask. Kuehlkamp et al. (Kuehlkamp et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib92)) in addition to detecting post-mortem deformations, as shown
    in Fig. [3](#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ 5\. Deep Learning-Based Forensic Iris Recognition

    visualization of a classification process. The visualization is based on Class
    Activation Mapping mechanism (Zhou et al., [2016](#bib.bib213)) and highlights
    salient features used by the classifier in its judgment. This novelty in iris
    recognition algorithms may help human examiners to locate iris regions that should

    humans and machines. They investigated which iris image regions humans and machines
    mainly attend to compare a pair of images. The machine-based attention maps are
    generated by Grad-CAM to highlight the regions that contribute the most to the
    deep learning model’s prediction. The human-based attention maps are learned by
    tracking the gaze as the human is looking around the screen that display iris
    image pairs and recording the regions where the human spend most time on. Interestingly
    while humans and machines tend to focus on a limited number of iris areas, however,
    the region, appearance and density of these areas between humans and machines
    are different. As salient regions proposed by the deep learning model and identified
    from human eye gaze do not overlap in general, the computer-added visual cues
    may potentially constitute a valuable addition to the forensic examiner’s expertise,
    as it can highlight important discriminatory regions that the human expert might
    miss in their proceedings. This human-machine pairing is important as human subjects
    can provide an incorrect decision even despite spending quite sometime observing
    many iris regions (NIST, [2021](#bib.bib121)). In addition, there has been a body
    of research showing that humans and machines do not perform similarly well under
    different conditions (Stark et al., [2010](#bib.bib155); Chen et al., [2016](#bib.bib21);
    Moreira et al., [2019](#bib.bib109)). For example, Moreira *et al.* also showed

    efforts have been paid to the development of human recognition methods that -
    apart the iris - also consider information in the vicinity of the eye to infer
    the identity. This is a relatively recent topic, termed as *periocular recognition*.
    The rationale is that the periocular region represents a trade-off between the
    face and the iris. Periocular biometrics has been claimed to be particularly useful

    model based on the U-Net architecture (Ronneberger et al., [2015](#bib.bib140)).

    models of Iris-recognition-OTS-DNN, a set of four architectures based on off-the-shelf
    CNNs trained for iris segmentation (two VGG-16 with dilated convolutions, one
    ResNet with dilated kernels, and one SegNet encoder/decoder). Training databases
    included CASIA-Irisv4-Interval, ND-Iris-0405, Warsaw-Post-Mortem v2.0 and ND-TWINS-2009-2010,
    whereas testing data came from ND-Iris-0405 (disjoint subject), BioSec and UBIRIS.v2.
    Results showed that the DL solutions evaluated outperform traditional segmentation
    techniques, e.g. Hough transform or integro-differential operators. It was also
    seen that each test dataset had a method that performs best, with UBIRIS obtaining
    the worst performance. This should not come as a surprise, since it contains VW
    images with high variability taking distantly with a digital camera, whereas the
    other two are from close-up NIR iris sensors in controlled environments.

    of their high-efficiency segmentation approach, IrisParseNet. A multi-task attention
    network was first applied to simultaneously predict the iris mask, pupil mask
    and iris outer boundary. Then, from the predicted masks and outer boundary, a
    parameterization of the iris boundaries was calculated. The solution is complete,
    in the sense that the mask (including light reflections and occlusions) and the
    parameterized inner and outer iris boundaries are jointly achieved.

    Networks (FCN) (Long et al., [2015](#bib.bib101)), Deeplab V1,V2,V3 (Chen et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib22)), ParseNet (Liu et al., [2016a](#bib.bib99)), PSPNet (Zhao

    and U-Net (Ronneberger et al., [2015](#bib.bib140)). The methods were evaluated
    on CASIA-Irisv4-Distance, MICHE-I and UBIRIS.v2. As in (Kerrigan et al., [2019](#bib.bib86)),
    results showed that the best method depends on the database, being: ParseNet for
    CASIA (NIR data), DeeplabV3 for MICHE (VW images from mobile devices), and U-Net
    for UBIRIS (VW images from a digital camera). In this case, however, the three
    tests databases behaved approximately equal, since they all contain difficult
    distant data. CASIA showed a slightly better accuracy, suggesting that NIR data
    may be easier to segment. Traditional, non-DL methods were also evaluated, concluding
    that DL-based segmentation achieves superior accuracy.'

    era, attracting growing interests from the research, commercial and governmental
    communities. In short, deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions
    of data to build computational models that - even in a bit surprising way - typically
    surpass the previous generation of handcrafted-based automata. However, being
    extremely data-driven, the effectiveness of DL-based solutions is typically constrained
    by the existence of massive amounts of data, annotated in a consistent way.

- en: As in the generality of the computer-vision topics, a myriad of DL-based techniques
    has been proposed over the last years to perform biometric recognition, and -
    in particular - iris recognition. Nowadays, the existing methods cover the whole
    phases of the typical processing chain, from the preprocessing, segmentation,
    feature extraction up to the matching and recognition steps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Accordingly, this article provides the first comprehensive review of the historical
    and state-of-the-art approaches in DL-based techniques for iris recognition, followed
    by an in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in each phase
    of the processing chain. We summarize and critically compare the most relevant
    methods for iris acquisition, segmentation, quality assessment, feature encoding,
    matching and recognition problems, also presenting the most relevant open-problems
    for each phase.

- en: Finally, we review the typical issues faced in DL-based methods in this domain
    of expertize, such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning
    and to illustrate how these challenges can be important to open prolific future
    research paths and solutions.
