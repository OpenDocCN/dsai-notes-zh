- en: Why does the literature consider the channel-state-information (CSI) as a 2/3-D
    image? What are the pros-and-cons of this consideration for accuracy-complexity
    trade-off? Next generations of wireless communications require innumerable disciplines
    according to which a low-latency, low-traffic, high-throughput, high spectral-efficiency
    and low energy-consumption are guaranteed. Towards this end, the principle of
    massive multi-input multi-output (MaMIMO) is emerging which is conveniently deployed
    for millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. However, practical and realistic MaMIMO transceivers
    suffer from a huge range of challenging bottlenecks in design the majority of
    which belong to the issue of channel-estimation. Channel modeling and prediction
    in MaMIMO particularly suffer from computational complexity due to a high number
    of antenna sets and supported users. This complexity lies dominantly upon the
    feedback-overhead which even degrades the pilot-data trade-off in the uplink (UL)/downlink
    (DL) design. This comprehensive survey studies the novel deep-learning (DLg) driven
    techniques recently proposed in the literature which tackle the challenges discussed-above
    - which is for the first time. In addition, we consequently propose 7 open trends
    e.g. in the context of the lack of Q-learning in MaMIMO detection - for which
    we talk about a possible solution to the saddle-point in the 2-D pilot-data axis
    for a Stackelberg game based scenario.

    to multi-standard and multi-functional wireless communications. The restricted
    design-budget and hardware resources cause a series of implementation bottlenecks
    at the user-equipment (UE) terminal. In relation to 5G standards, the principle
    of massive multi-input multi-output (MaMIMO) is emerging. MaMIMO dramatically
    enhances the spectral efficiency of the wireless network (Net) in addition to
    a guarantee for lower-latency and a higher energy efficiency.

    by the channel state-information (CSI) during the bandwidth (BW) of the system.
    In an orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM)-based system, the CSI
    is an $N_{t}\times N_{r}\times T\times B$ tensor [[1](#bib.bib1)] w.r.t. the channel
    matrix $\mathbf{H}$ of size $N_{t}\times N_{r}$. The values $N_{t}$, $N_{r}$,
    $B$ and $T$ stand respectively for the number of the transmit and receive antenna
    arrays, the numbers of subcarriers and OFDM symbols. The CSI is refreshed at a
    rate relying upon the correlation-time of the channel. For example, when CSI is
    low/high, the physical-layer needs to employ a low/high-order modulation scheme
    and a low/high coding rate for ensuring the bit-error-rate. Indeed, the CSI is
    a function of the attenuation of a radio signal over the air, that is, the impact
    of fading, path-loss, scattering, shadowing, atmosphere factors (rain, daytime
    based dynamicity/staticity obstacles, water vapor, molecules of oxygen, and other
    gaseous atmospheric components related to the time domain, air density, air humidity)
    etc [[2](#bib.bib2)]. After precisely considering all related factors, some certain
    patterns for CSI are observable. In particular, totally different frequency bands
    have totally different CSI even at the same location and at the same time-zone.
    Unfortunately, traditional equalisers fail for MaMIMO in millimeter waves (mmWaves).
    In fact, a simple linear channel-estimator¹¹1Such as zero-forcing. cannot guarantee
    an acceptable minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) over strong spatially correlated
    channels²²2A high number of antenna arrays in a high frequency carrier, succinctly
    speaking, makes the chipset less in size, leading to experience a correlated MaMIMO
    transceiver.. Moreover, by the classical MMSE estimator with a high complexity
    only a suboptimal estimations can be guaranteed. Therefore, novel algorithms which
    can efficiently guarantee the complexity-accuracy trade-off are still required
    as favourable as possible.

    parameters in the context of channel estimation, transmit-power allocation etc.
    These issues can be conveniently optimised through virtualising of tools according
    to deep-learning (DLg) based techniques. The basic architecture of a DLg mechanism
    is a multiple hidden-layer one. Indeed, any Borel measurable function according
    to the universal approximation theorem, can be inferred by a DLg network (Net).
    DLg procedures can solve complex non-convexities according to which the model
    is considered as a black box. For a DLg architecture, activation functions optimise
    multiple layers of the Net resulting in the favourable and accurate maps. The
    logic behind of a DLg framework in MaMIMO also stems principally from the following

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In FDD, the channel reciprocity is not satisfied due to the fact that the forward
    and reverse links generally have highly uncorrelated channels [[4](#bib.bib4)].
    In FDD, however, it is illustrated that the correlation of shadowing also exists
    between UL and DL [[5](#bib.bib5)]. There also seems to be a small multipath correlation
    between UL and DL channels in MaMIMO systems. However, the weak situation for
    the phase correlation degrades the phase recovery. In polar coordinate, additionally,
    uniform phase quantization results in quantisation error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There seems to be one totally important criterion which helps in the overhead-reduction
    interpretation as follows [[6](#bib.bib6)]. There is a small angular spread in
    relation to the channels between the base-station (BS) and User-equipments (UEs).
    This proves a sparsity in the angular domain. In FDD MaMIMO transceivers, compressed-sensing
    (CS)-based CSI feedback mechanisms³³3To sparsify CSI. are emerging in order to
    relax the channel dimension [[7](#bib.bib7)]. This is fulfilled with the aid of
    employing the sparse structures of CSI e.g., CSI’s temporal correlation, CSI’s
    spatial correlation and the sparsity-enhancing basis for CSI etc. The sparsity
    of CSI only holds for a few special models; something that cannot be generalised
    to a widely-accepted method for the case of model mismatch. As discussed in [[1](#bib.bib1)],
    the majority of the models in relation to time correlation is the block fading
    one. By this, the CSI dimensionality is relaxed by a factor of the blocklength.
    Also, the time correlation in slow-fading channels plays a key role [[8](#bib.bib8)].
    W.r.t. a certain threshold in relation to the reconstruction error⁴⁴4Relating
    to the distortion/loss function. the relative methods reuse the previously retained
    CSI for the subsequent CSI reconstruction. However, the reused information is
    hard to be updated in a real-time manner. For the fast-fading channels the problem
    is going to be worse since the resolution is degraded resulting in the failure
    of the feedback-overhead reduction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is required to leverage the CSI linear correlations in the spatial and time
    domains as well as the frequency one. The literature mainly concentrates on the
    spatial correlation by transforming the CSI to the angular domain. Moreover, the
    time correlation is physically modeled by a Gaussian-Markov process. Some recent
    work mentioned in [[9](#bib.bib9)] in which an efficient orthogonal-space-time-frequency
    coding scheme was technically proposed for OFDM based systems. The aforementioned
    scheme talked about how to employ the CSI correlation in the frequency domain
    which lies in the sparse multipath component. Additionally, the linear correlation
    among collocated antenna sets reduces the CSI overhead in the spatial domain.
    However, the distance between two remote BSs degrades this assumption.

- en: In MaMIMO systems, w.r.t. the pilot-length $L_{s}$, barely does the condition
    of $L_{s}\geq N_{t}$ hold [[13](#bib.bib13)]. This is due to three main reasons
    which are expressed as follows. First, w.r.t. the aforementioned condition, a
    huge amount of time is necessary for the pilot transmission. This consequently
    leads to a less spectral efficiency w.r.t. the data-pilot trade-off. Secondly,
    the complexity rises as $L_{s}$ rises. Finally, the condition cited above may
    be impossible in some circumstances, since $L_{s}$ cannot be larger than the uncontrollable
    criterion of the channel-coherence-time. On the other hand, the condition $L_{s}<N_{t}$
    for the MaMIMO channel estimation is somehow impossible in practical situation
    due the following reasons. It is, in fact, impossible to design the pilot matrix
    in the sense that its row vectors would be able to be orthogonal. However, this
    orthogonality is required for interference mitigation among the pilot sequences
    transmitted from various antennas. The aforementioned impossibility indicates
    $L_{s}\nless N_{t}$. Secondly, there is no guarantee for the optimality of the
    MMSE channel estimator if $L_{s}<N_{t}$ holds. This comes from a non-convex nature
    of the original optimisation problem.

    of UP-BW resources, even though it tackles a lot of obstacles [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    An optimisation over the usage of the UL-BW is still highly regarded since the
    chief focus of the literature for DL-based CSI feedback in FDD MaMIMO systems
    is on feedback reduction. In the training phase, pre-marked data are fed into
    the Net in order to find the most optimised version of the Net-connection weights.
    Towards this end, the gradient descent method is widely used. However, the gradient
    will vanish when the Net-layers are high [[14](#bib.bib14)]; something that results
    in increasing the training time and even relevant-information drop-out. Additionally,
    the performance of the detection-Net called DetNet [[15](#bib.bib15)] (shown in
    Fig. [3](#S2.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ II-A Challenges to frequency division duplexing (FDD)

    of antenna sets, worse⁶⁶6Although DetNet has an acceptable robustness and flexibility,
    since it can adapt to an extended SNR regime and for various channels.. Furthermore,
    DetNet fails if the number of transmitter’s antennas is close to or larger than
    the number of receiving antennas.

    it is somehow impossible to assign each antenna to the RF chain. The main problem
    is indeed the energy consumption as well as the hardware cost. In order to guarantee
    a widely acceptable trade-off between system performance and hardware cost, the
    principle of HBF is considered. This type of novel beamforming divides the beamforming
    operations between the analog and digital domains. HBF exploits a low-dimensional
    digital precoder in the subsequence with a high-dimensional analog-precoder. Therefore,
    a sufficient-and-necessary number of antennas with much fewer RF chains are assigned.
    The signals are phase shifted in the RF⁷⁷7Since the relistic RF power harvesting
    counterpart includes only rectifiers, no ability of the RF-to-baseband conversion
    (baseband processing generally speaking) exists. This causes an impossible actualisation
    of a realistic energy receiver. using analog phase shifters prior of which they
    are digitally precoded in the baseband⁸⁸8These HBFs are twofold namely fully-connected
    architectures and sub-array-connected ones.. This issue enforces the 5G Net operators
    to find a significantly more suitable solution instead of exploiting simple traditional
    time-division-duplexing (TDD)/FDD techniques (prevalently used in the previous
    generations). This is because when the receiver is equipped with a limited number
    of RF chains, channel/direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is totally difficult
    [[16](#bib.bib16)], [[17](#bib.bib17)], [[18](#bib.bib18)], [[19](#bib.bib19)].
    In other words, in a MaMIMO transceiver equipped with a large number of unknown
    channel parameters but a small number of RF chains, a huge amount of time is required
    for training phase, resulting a long delay. In this delay time, channel may be
    varied. Furthermore, mmWave channels is of a purely limited scattering-based nature,
    resulting in a specific angular sparsity for which CS may be required. In vehicular

    proposed. This aimed at analysing the archived data for online CSI estimation
    containing a 2D CNN Net, a 1D CNN Net, and an LSTM-Net. Specifically, in the first
    stage, the 2D CNN Net is used to construct the frequency-feature vector from CSI
    images. In this level, since the CSI images are high-dimensional tensors, a flatten-layer
    applies a concatenation procedure by which these tensors are alleviated into 1-D
    vectors. In particular, CSI is actualised with an integration of the influences
    stem from path loss, diffraction, scattering, fading, shadowing, frequency band,
    location, time, temperature, humidity, and weather. Indeed, the spatial-temporal
    relevance (correlation) of the CSI resulted in proposing a DL-based scheme which

    well as the bi-directional correlation of the relative magnitudes are the two
    totally central keys. Both UL CSI and DL feedback are the input of the DLg Nets
    for decoding the most informative and efficient feedback code-word. The novelty

    correlation ensures a fundamentally performance reinforcement for DL CSI prediction

- en: A brilliant proposition of mapping the channel coefficients at a given set of
    antenna arrays and a given frequency band to the channel data sets at another
    set of antenna arrays at a totally different location and a totally different
    frequency band was performed in [[37](#bib.bib37)]. According to this type of
    novel channel-to-channel mapping the authors efficiently guaranteed remarkable
    gains for MaMIMO systems. In particular, in FDD MaMIMO, the UL channel data sets
    can be theoretically mapped to the DL ones. This is also fine in addition to a
    mapping of the DL channel coefficients at a given subset of antenna arrays to
    the DL ones at all the other antenna sets. According to this, a considrable-and-efficient
    relaxation to the DL training/feedback overhead was totally proven to be guaranteed.
    For cell-free/distributed MaMIMO systems, furthermore, this novel kind of channel
    mapping is interpreted as follows. This is an efficient alleviation to the front-haul
    signaling overhead and even an extreme range of the generalised scenarios and
    problem-and-solutions.

    received signal, followed by a conventional least-squares estimation. This scheme
    efficiently works the same as MMSE estimator for high-dimensional signals, inversely,
    MMSE’s requirement for complex channel inversions as well as the statistical knowledge
    of the CSI are not mandatory. The proposed method while it was efficiently proven
    that it is not necessary any training, this has also a robustness to pilot-contamination.
    This is also valid even if the number of antenna sets, subcarriers and coherence
    time interval (in terms of OFDM symbols) increase under a synchronisation error
    at the BS. The proposed method is really robust in the sense that it can perfectly
    remove the interference even if the eigen-space of the desired user and interference
    are strongly correlated.

- en: A DLg approach was theoretically proposed [[44](#bib.bib44)] to efficiently
    predicte the UL channels for mixed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), while
    a portion of antennas exploit low-resolution ADCs at the BS. The remaining antenna
    sets are essentially equipped with high-resolution ones. Only the signals received
    by the high-resolution ADC antenna sets are fully applied to efficiently estimate
    the channels of other antenna arrays in addition to their own channels. The out-performance
    of the proposed method over the existing ones, particularly mixed one-bit ADCs
    are completely shown. In MaMIMO, aimed at efficiently guaranteeing the hardware-cost
    reduction, low-resolution ADCs e.g. $1$-to-$3$ bits, are emerging. However, the
    low-resolution ADCs in practice experience the severely nonlinear distortion,
    in data detection. The mixed-ADCs are, instead, the candidates to efficiently
    reduce the hardware complexity, inversely, their overall-throughput, particularly
    for mixed one-bit ADC still lacks. A DLg based channel estimation mechanism was
    technically proposed in [[44](#bib.bib44)] for mixed-ADC MaMIMO UL. A novel estimation
    mapping from the channels of high-resolution ADC antenna sets to those of low-resolution
    ADC antenna arrays was efficiently proposed. This was theoretically characterised
    aimed at providing a relaxation to the detrimental knock-on effects of the severely
    distorted signals quantised by the low-resolution ADCs on the prediction accuracy.
    This framework is also implementable for the case with fewer high-resolution ADC
    antenna sets or correspondingly low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

    as discussed, there seems to be five crucial problems in relation to CS techniques
    in MaMIMO channel modeling and estimation. The aforementioned problems, specifically,
    the feedback-overhead, enforced the scholars and researchers in both Academia
    and Industry to pursue their trends towards DLg oriented mechanisms. Additionally,
    FDD has more challenging bottlenecks compared to TDD. More interestingly, we proposed
    a possible game-theoretical solution in terms of Q-learning – something that was
