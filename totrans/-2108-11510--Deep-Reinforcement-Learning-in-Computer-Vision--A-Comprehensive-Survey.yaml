- en: Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and
    utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have
    demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various
    domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer
    vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art
    research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start
    with *comprehending the theories* of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and
    deep reinforcement learning. We then *propose a categorization* of deep reinforcement
    learning methodologies and *discuss their advantages and limitations*. In particular,
    we divide deep reinforcement learning into *seven main categories* according to
    their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i) landmark localization (ii) object
    detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image
    volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other
    applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement
    learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive
    analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability.
    Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research directions on
    deep reinforcement learning in computer vision.

- en: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique for learning a sequence
    of actions in an interactive environment by trial and error that maximizes the
    expected reward [[351](#bib.bib351)]. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the
    combination of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning (DL) and it has become
    one of the most intriguing areas of artificial intelligence today. DRL can solve
    a wide range of complex real-world decision-making problems with human-like intelligence
    that were previously intractable. DRL was selected by [[316](#bib.bib316)], [[106](#bib.bib106)]
    as one of ten breakthrough techniques in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

    achievement in solving challenging decision-making problems in the real world.
    DRL has been successfully applied into many domains including games, robotics,
    autonomous driving, healthcare, natural language processing, and computer vision.
    In contrast to supervised learning which requires large labeled training data,
    DRL samples training data from an environment. This opens up many machine learning
    applications where big labeled training data does not exist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Far from supervised learning, DRL-based approaches focus on solving sequential
    decision-making problems. They aim at deciding, based on a set of experiences
    collected by interacting with the environment, the sequence of actions in an uncertain
    environment to achieve some targets. Different from supervised learning where
    the feedback is available after each system action, it is simply a scalar value
    that may be delayed in time in the DRL framework. For example, the success or
    failure of the entire system is reflected after a sequence of actions. Furthermore,
    the supervised learning model is updated based on the loss/error of the output
    and there is no mechanism to get the correct value when it is wrong. This is addressed
    by policy gradients in DRL by assigning gradients without a differentiable loss
    function. This aims at teaching a model to try things out randomly and learn to
    do correct things more.

    [[414](#bib.bib414)] have been introduced recently. While [[13](#bib.bib13)] covers
    central algorithms in DRL, [[97](#bib.bib97)] provides an introduction to DRL
    models, algorithms, and techniques, where particular focus is the aspects related
    to generalization and how DRL can be used for practical applications. Recently,
    [[414](#bib.bib414)] introduces a survey, which discusses the broad applications
    of RL techniques in healthcare domains ranging from dynamic treatment regimes
    in chronic diseases and critical care, an automated medical diagnosis from both
    unstructured and structured clinical data, to many other control or scheduling
    domains that have infiltrated many aspects of a healthcare system. Different from
    the previous work, our survey focuses on how to implement DRL in various computer
    vision applications such as landmark detection, object detection, object tracking,
    image registration, image segmentation, and video analysis.

    and other applications of DRL. Each application category first starts with a problem
    introduction and then state-of-the-art approaches in the field are discussed and
    compared through a summary table. We are going to discuss some future perspectives
    in section [12](#S12 "12 Future Perspectives ‣ Deep Reinforcement Learning in

- en: Compared to traditional machine learning methods, CNN has achieved state-of-the-art
    performance in many domains including image understanding, video analysis and
    audio/speech recognition. In image understanding [[404](#bib.bib404)], [[426](#bib.bib426)],
    CNN outperforms human capacities [[39](#bib.bib39)]. Video analysis [[422](#bib.bib422)],
    [[217](#bib.bib217)] is another application that turns the CNN model from a detector
    [[374](#bib.bib374)] into a tracker [[94](#bib.bib94)]. As a special case of image
    segmentation [[194](#bib.bib194)], [[193](#bib.bib193)], saliency detection is
    another computer vision application that uses CNN [[381](#bib.bib381)], [[213](#bib.bib213)].
    In addition to the previous applications, pose estimation [[290](#bib.bib290)],
    [[362](#bib.bib362)] is another interesting research that uses CNN to estimate
    human-body pose. Action recognition in both still images and videos is a special
    case of recognition and is a challenging problem. [[110](#bib.bib110)] utilizes
    CNN-based representation of contextual information in which the most representative
    secondary region within a large number of object proposal regions, together with
    the contextual features, is used to describe the primary region. CNN-based action
    recognition in video sequences is reviewed in [[420](#bib.bib420)]. Text detection
    and recognition using CNN is the next step of optical character recognition (OCR)
    [[406](#bib.bib406)] and word spotting [[160](#bib.bib160)]. Not only in computer
    vision, CNN has been successfully applied into other domains such as speech recognition
    and speech synthesis [[274](#bib.bib274)], [[283](#bib.bib283)], biometrics [[242](#bib.bib242)],
    [[85](#bib.bib85)], [[281](#bib.bib281)], [[350](#bib.bib350)],[[304](#bib.bib304)],

    in RL. In order to provide a quick overview of what constitutes the main components
    of RL methods, some fundamental concepts and major theoretical problems are also
    clarified. RL is a kind of machine learning method where agents learn the optimal
    policy by trial and error. Unlike supervised learning, the feedback is available
    after each system action, it is simply a scalar value that may be delayed in time
    in RL framework, for example, the success or failure of the entire system is reflected
    after a sequence of actions. Furthermore, the supervised learning model is updated
    based on the loss/error of the output and there is no mechanism to get the correct
    value when it is wrong. This is addressed by policy gradients in RL by assigning
    gradients without a differentiable loss function which aims at teaching a model
    to try things out randomly and learn to do correct things more.

    decision-making problems which exist in many applications such as games, robotics,
    healthcare, smart grids, stock, autonomous driving, etc. Unlike supervised learning
    where the data is given, an artificial agent collects experiences (data) by interacting
    with its environment in RL framework. Such experience is then gathered to optimize
    the cumulative rewards/utilities.

    that can make decisions in an environment to optimize some objectives presented
    under reward functions. Some key aspects of RL are: (i) Address the sequential
    decision making; (ii) There is no supervisor, only a reward presented as scalar
    number; and (iii) The feedback is highly delayed. Markov Decision Process (MDP)
    is a framework that has commonly been used to solve most RL problems with discrete
    actions, thus we will first discuss MDP in this section. We then introduce value
    function and how to categorize RL into model-based or model-free methods. At the
    end of this section, we discuss some challenges in RL.'

    Notably, agent’s algorithm for choosing action $a$ given current state $s$, which
    in general can be viewed as distribution $\pi(a|s)$, is called a policy (strategy).
    The environment receives the action, produces a reward $r_{t+1}$ and transfers
    to the next state $s_{t+1}$ according to the transition probability $T(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t})$.
    The process continues until the agent reaches a terminal state or a maximum time
    step. In RL framework, the tuple $(s_{t},a_{t},r_{t+1},s_{t+1})$ is called transition.

- en: DRL, which was proposed as a combination of RL and DL, has achieved rapid developments,
    thanks to the rich context representation of DL. Under DRL, the aforementioned
    value and policy can be expressed by neural networks which allow dealing with
    a continuous state or action that was hard for a table representation. Similar
    to RL, DRL can be categorized into model-based algorithms and model-free algorithms
    which will be introduced in this section.

    In order to address this limitation, Dueling DQN [[390](#bib.bib390)] incorporates

    This can be implemented by splitting the fully connected layers in the DQN architecture
    to compute the advantage and state value functions separately, then combining
    them back into a single Q-function. An interesting result has shown that Dueling

    i.e. policy gradient methods are better for continuous and stochastic environments,
    and have a faster convergence whereas, value-based methods are more sample efficient
    and steady. Lately, actor-critic [[182](#bib.bib182)] [[262](#bib.bib262)] was
    born to take advantage from both value-based and policy gradient while limiting
    their drawbacks. Actor-critic architecture computes the policy gradient using
    a value-based critic function to estimate expected future reward. The principal
    idea of actor-critic is to divide the model into two parts: (i) computing an action
    based on a state and (ii) producing the Q values of the action. As given in Fig.[9](#S4.F9
    "Figure 9 ‣ 4.1.3 Actor-Critic DRL algorithm ‣ 4.1 Model-Free Algorithms ‣ 4 Introduction
    to Deep Reinforcement Learning ‣ Deep Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision:
    A Comprehensive Survey"), the actor takes as input the state $s_{t}$ and outputs
    the best action $a_{t}$. It essentially controls how the agent behaves by learning
    the optimal policy (policy-based). The critic, on the other hand, evaluates the
    action by computing the value function (value-based). The most basic actor-critic
    method (beyond the tabular case) is naive policy gradients (REINFORCE). The relationship
    between actor-critic is similar to kid-mom. The kid (actor) explores the environment
    around him/her with new actions i.e. tough fire, hit a wall, climb a tree, etc
    while the mom (critic) watches the kid and criticizes/compliments him/her. The
    kid then adjusts his/her behavior based on what his/her mom told. When the kids
    get older, he/she can realize which action is bad/good.'

    to implement an Actor-Critic agent. Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)

    a lot of memory. Instead, A3C asynchronously executes different agents in parallel
    on multiple instances of the environment. Each worker (copy of the network) will
    update the global network asynchronously. Because of the asynchronous nature of
    A3C, some workers (copy of the agents) will work with older values of the parameters.
    Thus the aggregating update will not be optimal. On the other hand, A2C synchronously
    updates the global network. A2C waits until all workers finished their training
    and calculated their gradients to average them, to update the global network.
    In order to update the entire network, A2C waits for each actor to finish their
    segment of experience before updating the global parameters. As a consequence,
    the training will be more cohesive and faster. Different from A3C, each worker
    in A2C has the same set of weights since and A2C updates all their workers at
    the same time. In short, A2C is an alternative to the synchronous version of the

    of automation for evaluating data. The motivation behind using an algorithm for
    landmarking instead of a person is that manual annotation is a time-consuming
    tedious task and is prone to errors. Many efforts have been made for the automation
    of this task. Most of the works that were published for this task using a machine
    learning algorithm to solve the problem. [[64](#bib.bib64)] proposed a regression
    forest-based method for detecting landmark in a full-body CT scan. Although the
    method was fast it was less accurate when dealing with large organs. [[101](#bib.bib101)]

    [[105](#bib.bib105)] reformulated the detection problem as a behavior learning
    task for an artificial agent using MDP. By using the capabilities of DRL and scale-space
    theory [[226](#bib.bib226)], the optimal search strategies for finding anatomical
    structures are learned based on the image information at multiple scales. In their
    approach, the search starts at the coarsest scale level for capturing global context
    and continues to finer scales for capturing more local information. In their RL
    configuration, the state of the agent at time $t$, $s_{t}=I(\vec{p}_{t})$ is defined
    as an axis-aligned box of image intensities extracted from the image $I$ and centered
    at the voxel-position $\vec{p}_{t}$ in image space. An action $a_{t}$ allows the
    agent to move from any voxel position $\vec{p}_{t}$ to an adjacent voxel position
    $\vec{p}_{t+1}$. The reward function represents distance-based feedback, which
    is positive if the agent gets closer to the target structure and negative otherwise.
    In this work, a CNN is used to extract deep semantic features. The search starts
    with the coarsest scale level $M-1$, the algorithm tries to maximize the reward
    which is the change in distance between ground truth and predicted landmark location
    before and after the action of moving the scale window across the image. Upon
    convergence, the scale level is changed to $M-2$ and the search continued from
    the convergence point at scale level $M-1$. The process is repeated on the following
    scales until convergence on the finest scale. The authors performed experiments
    on 3D CT scans and obtained an average accuracy increase of 20-30$\%$ and lower
    distance error than the other techniques such as SADNN [[104](#bib.bib104)] and

    proposed and demonstrated use cases of several different Deep Q-Network RL models
    to train agents that can precisely localize target landmarks in medical scans.
    In their work, they formulate the landmark detection problem as an MDP of a goal-oriented
    agent, where an artificial agent is learned to make a sequence of decisions towards
    the target point of interest. At each time step, the agent should decide which
    direction it has to move to find the target landmark. These sequential actions
    form a learned policy forming a path between the starting point and the target
    landmark. This sequential decision-making process is approximated under RL. In
    this RL configuration, the environment is defined as a 3D input image, action
    $A$ is a set of six actions $a_{x}+,a_{x}-,a_{y}+,a_{y}-,a_{z}+,a_{z}-$ corresponding
    to three directions, the state $s$ is defined as a 3D region of interest (ROI)
    centered around the target landmark and the reward is chosen as the difference
    between the two Euclidean distances: the previous step and current step. This
    reward signifies whether the agent is moving closer to or further away from the
    desired target location. In this work, they also proposed a novel fixed- and multi-scale

    localization problems, [[7](#bib.bib7)] adopts an actor-critic [[262](#bib.bib262)]
    based direct policy search method framed in a temporal difference learning approach.
    In their work, the state is defined as a function of the agent-position which
    allows the agent at any position to observe an $m\times m\times 3$ block of surrounding
    voxels. Similar to other previous work, the action space is $a_{x}+,a_{x}-,a_{y}+,a_{y}-,a_{z}+,a_{z}-$.
    The reward is chosen as a simple binary reward function, where a positive reward
    is given if an action leads the agent closer to the target landmark, and a negative
    reward is given otherwise. Far apart from the previous work, their approach proposes
    a non-linear policy function approximator represented by an MLP whereas the value
    function approximator is presented by another MLP stacked on top of the same CNN
    from the policy net. Both policy (actor) and value (critic) networks are updated
    by actor-critic learning. To improve the learning, they introduce a partial policy-based
    RL to enable solving the large problem of localization by learning the optimal
    policy on smaller partial domains. The objective of the partial policy is to obtain
    multiple simple policies on the projections of the actual action space, where
    the projected policies can reconstruct the policy on the original action space.

    and non-random within the human anatomy and this is necessary as the localization
    of different landmarks requires learning partly heterogeneous policies, [[377](#bib.bib377)]
    concluded that one landmark can help to deduce the location of others. For collective
    gain, the agents share their accumulated knowledge during training. In their approach,
    the state is defined as RoI centered around the location of the agent. The reward
    function is defined as the relative improvement in Euclidean distance between
    their location at time $t$ and the target landmark location. Each agent is considered
    as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [[107](#bib.bib107)] and
    calculates its individual reward as their policies are disjoint. In order to reduce
    the computational load in locating multiple landmarks and increase accuracy through
    anatomical interdependence, they propose a collaborative multi-agent landmark
    detection framework (Collab-DQN) where DQN is built upon a CNN. The backbone CNN
    is shared across all agents while the policy-making fully connected layers are

    introduced Reinforced Axial Refinement Network (RARN) for monocular 3D object
    detection by utilizing an RL model to iteratively refining the sampled bounding
    box to be more overlapped with the groundtruth bounding box. Given a state having

    coordinates in a direction at every timestep, the model is trained by DQN method
    with the immediate reward is the improvement in detection accuracy between every

    a function $f(W_{0})$ that takes in $S_{t}$ and frame as input, where $S_{t}$
    is the object location for the first frame and is zero elsewhere. The output is
    fed to an LSTM module [[139](#bib.bib139)] with past hidden state $h_{t}$. The

    facial landmarks in real-time was proposed by [[118](#bib.bib118)]. The dual-agent
    DRL method (DADRL) mentioned in the paper consisted of two agents: a tracking
    and an alignment agent. The problem of object tracking was formulated as an MDP
    where state consisted of image regions extracted by the bounding box and a total
    of 8 actions (left, right, up, down, scale-up, scale down, stop and continue)
    were used, where first six consists of movement actions used by tracking agent
    and last two for alignment agent. The tracking agent is responsible for changing
    the current observable region and the alignment agent determines whether the iteration
    should be terminated. For the tracking agent, the reward corresponded to the misalignment
    descent and for the alignment agent the reward was $+\eta$ for misalignment less
    than the threshold and $-\eta$ otherwise. The DADRL implementation also consisted
    of communicated message channels beside the tracking agent and the alignment agent.
    The tracking agent consisted of a VGG-M [[340](#bib.bib340)] backbone followed
    by a one-layer Q-Network and the alignment agent was designed as a combination
    of a stacked hourglass network with a confidence network. The two communicated

    The actor network, the prediction network, and the critic network, where all three

    for the alignment of two or more images. The goal of 3D medical image registration
    is to find a correlation between two images from either different patients or
    the same patients at different times, where the images can be Computed Tomography
    (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
    In the process, the images are brought to the same coordinate system and aligned
    with each other. The reason for image registration being a challenging task is
    the fact that the two images used may have a different coordinate system, scale,
    or resolution.

    strategy with local optimizers to perform 2D or 3D image registration was performed

    field of views. Heuristic semi-global optimization schemes were proposed to solve

    where the authors used DRL for alignment of depth data with medical images. In
    the specified work Duel DQN was used as the agent for estimating the state value
    and the advantage function, and the cropped 3D image tensor of both data modalities
    was considered as the state. The algorithm’s goal was to estimate a transformation
    function that could align moving images to a fixed image by maximizing a similarity
    function between the fixed and moving image. A large number of convolution and
    pooling layer were used to extract high-level contextual information, batch normalization
    and concatenation of feature vector from last convolution layer with action history
    vector was used to solve the problem of oscillation and closed loops, and Double
    DQN architecture for updating the network weights was used.

    and variability in appearance. To overcome these issues [[184](#bib.bib184)] proposed
    a robust non-rigid agent-based method for image registration. The method involves
    finding a spatial transformation $T_{\theta}$ that can map the fixed image with
    the floating image using actions at each time step, that is responsible for optimizing
    $\theta$. If the $\theta$ is a d dimensional vector then there will be 2d possible
    actions. In this work, a DQN was used as an agent for value estimation, along
    with a reward that corresponded to the change in $\theta$ distance between ground
    truth and predicted transformations across an action.

    vision, where the algorithm is responsible for labeling each pixel position as
    foreground or background corresponding to the object being segmented in the image.
    Image segmentation has a wide variety of applications in medical, robotics, weather,
    etc. One of the earlier attempts with image segmentation includes [[125](#bib.bib125)].
    With the improvement in detection techniques and introduction of CNN, new methods
    are introduced every year for image segmentation. Mask R-CNN [[132](#bib.bib132)]
    extended the work by Faster R-CNN [[309](#bib.bib309)] by adding a segmentation
    layer after the Bounding box has been predicted. Some earlier works include [[109](#bib.bib109)],
    [[127](#bib.bib127)], [[128](#bib.bib128)] etc. Most of these works give promising
    results in image segmentation. However, due to the supervised nature of CNN and
    R-CNN, these algorithms need a large amount of data. In fields like medical, the
    data is sometimes not readily available hence we needed a way to train algorithms
    to perform a given task when there are data constraints. Luckily RL tends to shine
    when the data is not available in a large quantity.

    proposed a method for indoor semantic segmentation through RL. In their paper,

    of different objects into a single multi-object segmentation mask. They formulated
    the binary mask in a Conditional Random Field Framework (CRF), and used a logistic
    regression version of AdaBoost [[140](#bib.bib140)] for classification. The authors
    considered the problem of adding multiple binary segmentation into one as an MDP,
    where the state consisted of a list of probability distributions of different
    objects in an image, and the actions correspond to the selection of object/background
    segmentation for a particular object in the sequential semantic segmentation.
    In the RL framework, the reward was considered in terms of pixel-wise frequency
    weighted Jaccard Index computed over the set of actions taken at any stage of

    image and initial seed points, the algorithm is capable of generating additional
    seed points and image segmentation results. The implementation included Random
    Walk (RW) [[114](#bib.bib114)] as the segmentation algorithm and DQN for value
    estimation by considering the problem as an MDP. They used the current binary
    segmentation mask and image features as the state, the actions corresponded to
    selecting seed points in a sparse matrix of size $20\times 20$(800 different actions
    were possible), and the reward consisted of the change in IOU across an action.

    a method to refine an initial course segmentation produced by some segmentation
    methods using RL, where the state consisted of the image, previous segmentation
    probability, and user hint map. The actions corresponded to adjusting the segmentation
    probability for refinement of segmentation, and a relative cross-entropy gain-based
    reward to update the model in a constrained direction was used. In simple words,
    it is the relative improvement of previous segmentation to the current one. The

- en: Video object segmentation using human-provided location priors have been capable
    of producing promising results. An RL method for this task was proposed by [[373](#bib.bib373)],
    in which the authors proposed MASK-RL, a multiagent RL framework for object segmentation
    in videos. They proposed a weakly supervised method where the location priors
    were provided by the user in form of clicks using gamification (Web game to collect
    location priors by different users) to support the segmentation and used a Gaussian
    filter to emphasize the areas. The segmentation network is fed a 12 channel input
    tensor that contained a sequence of video frames and their corresponding location
    priors (3 $\times$ 3 color channels + three gray-scale images). The authors used
    a fully convoluted DenseNet [[147](#bib.bib147)] with down-sampling and up-sampling
    similar to U-Net [[313](#bib.bib313)] and an LSTM [[139](#bib.bib139)] for the
    segmentation network. For the RL method, the actor takes a series of steps over
    a frame divided into a grid of equal size patches and makes the decision whether
    there is an object in the patch or not. In their MDP formulation the states consisted
    of the input frame, optical flow (computed by [[156](#bib.bib156)]) from the previous
    frame, patch from the previous iteration, and the episode location history, the
    actions consisted of movement actions (up, down, left and right) and set action
    (action to place location prior at a random location on the patch), and two types
    of rewards one for set actions and one for movement actions were used. The reward
    was calculated using the clicks generated by the game player.

    focuses on categorizing the action that is being performed in the video frame.
    To address the problem a deep progressive RL (DPRL) method for action recognition
    in skeleton-based videos was proposed by [[357](#bib.bib357)]. The authors proposed
    a method that distills the most informative frames and discards ambiguous frames
    by considering the quality of the frame and the relationship of the frame with
    the complete video along with a graph-based structure to map the human body in
    form of joints and vertices. DPRL was utilized to filter out informative frames
    in a video and graph-based CNNs were used to learn the spatial dependency between
    the joints. The approach consisted of two sub-networks, a frame distillation network
    (FDNet) to filter a fixed number of frames from input sequence using DPRL and
    GCNN to recognize the action labels using output in form of a graphical structure
    by the FDNet. The authors modeled the problem as an MDP where the state consisted
    of the concatenation of two tensors $F$ and $M$, where $F$ consisted of global
    information about the video and $M$ consisted of the frames that were filtered,
    The actions which correspond to the output of FDNet were divided into three types:
    shifting to left, staying the same and shifting to the right, and the reward function
    corresponded to the change in probability of categorizing the video equal to the
    ground truth clipped it between [-1 and 1] and is provided by GCNN to FDNet.'

    that involves predicting the object or the task that is being performed in a video.
    A DRL method for unsupervised video summarisation was proposed by [[429](#bib.bib429)],
    in which the authors proposed a Diversity-Representativeness reward system and
    a deep summarisation network (DSN) which was capable of predicting a probability
    for each video frame that specified the likeliness of selecting the frame and
    then take actions to form video summaries. They used an encode-decoder framework
    for the DSN where GoogLeNet [[355](#bib.bib355)] pre-trained on ImageNet [[320](#bib.bib320)]
    [[72](#bib.bib72)] was used as an encoder and a bidirectional RNNs (BiRNNs) topped
    with a fully connected (FC) layer was used as a decoder. The authors modeled the
    problem as an MDP where the action corresponded to the task of selecting or rejecting
    a frame. They proposed a novel Diversity-Representativeness Reward Function in
    their implementation, where diversity reward corresponded to the degree of dissimilarity
    among the selected frames in feature space, and representativeness reward measured
    how well the generated summary can represent the original video. For the RNN unit
    they used an LSTM [[139](#bib.bib139)] to capture long-term video dependencies
    and used REINFORCE algorithm for training the policy function.

    left, right, and stop), probe position as compared to the sacrum was used as the
    state and the reward was calculated by considering the agent position as compared
    to the target (Move closer: 0.05, Move away: -0.1, Correct stop: 1.0, Incorrect
    stop: -0.25). In their implementation, the authors proposed various architectures

    for humans. A DRL method for crowd counting was proposed by [[230](#bib.bib230)],
    where the authors used sequential decision making to approach the task through
    RL. In the specified work, the authors proposed a DQN agent (LibraNet) based on
    the motivation of a weighing scale. In their implementation crowd counting was
    modeled using a weighing scale where the agent was responsible for adding weights
    on one side of the scale sequentially to balance the crowded image on the other
    side. The problem of adding weights on one side of the pan for balancing was formulated
    as an MDP, where state consisted weight vector $W_{t}$ and image feature vector
    $FV_{I}$, and the actions space was defined similar to scale weighing and money
    system [[372](#bib.bib372)] containing values $(-10,-5,-2,-1,+1,+2,+5,+10,end)$.
    For reinforcing the agent two different rewards: ending reward and intermediate
    reward were utilized, where ending reward (following [[43](#bib.bib43)]) was calculated
    by comparing the absolute value error between the ground-truth count and the accumulated

    is captured using multiple exposures for getting a high dynamic range (HDR) image.
    An RL method for automated bracketing selection was proposed by [[389](#bib.bib389)].
    For flexible automated bracketing selection, an exposure bracketing selection
    network (EBSNet) was proposed for selecting optimal exposure bracketing and a
    multi-exposure fusion network (MEFNet) for generating an HDR image from selected
    exposure bracketing which consisted of 3 images. Since there is no ground truth
    for the exposure bracketing selection procedure, an RL scheme was utilized to
    train the agent (EBSNet). The authors also introduced a novel dataset consisting
    of a single auto-exposure image that was used as input to the EBSNet, 10 images
    with varying exposures from which EBSNet generated probability distribution for
    120 possible candidate exposure bracketing ($C^{3}_{10}$) and a reference HDR
    image. The reward for EBSNet was defined as the difference between peak signal-to-noise
    ratio between generated and reference HDR for the current and previous iteration,
    and the MEFNet was trained by minimizing the Charbonnier loss [[23](#bib.bib23)].
    For performing the action of bracketing selection ESBNet consisted of a semantic
    branch using AlexNet [[188](#bib.bib188)] for feature extraction, an illumination
    branch to understand the global and local illuminations by calculating a histogram
    of input and feeding it to CNN layers, and a policy module to generate a probability
    distribution for the candidate exposure bracketing from semantic and illumination
    branches. The neural network for MEFNet was derived from HDRNet [[103](#bib.bib103)].

    a large number of environmental variables and constraints. A DRL approach to this
    problem was proposed by [[361](#bib.bib361)]. In their implementation, the authors
    proposed an end-to-end model-free RL method, where they introduced a novel technique
    called Implicit Affordances. For the environment, the CARLA Simulator [[80](#bib.bib80)]
    was utilized, which provided the observations and the training reward was obtained
    by using the CARLA waypoint API. In the novel implicit affordances technique the
    training was broken into two phases, The first phase included using a Resnet18
    [[133](#bib.bib133)] encoder to predict the state of various environment variables
    such as traffic light, pedestrians, position with respect to the center lane,
    etc., and the output features were used as a state for the RL agent, For which
    a modified version of Rainbow-IQN Ape-X [[136](#bib.bib136)] was used. CARLA simulator
    accepts actions in form of continuous steering and throttle values, so to make
    it work with Rainbow-IQN which supports discrete actions, the authors sampled
    steering values into 9 or 27 discrete values and throttle into 4 discrete values
    (including braking), making a total of 36($9\times 4$) or 108($27\times 4$) actions.

    authors, the reason for racial bias in facial recognition algorithms can be either
    due to the data or due to the algorithm, so the authors provided two ethnicity-aware
    datasets, BUPT-Globalface and BUPT-Balancedface along with an RL based race balanced
    network (RL-RBN). In their implementation, the authors formulated an MDP for adaptive
    margin policy learning where the state consisted of three parts: the race group
    (0: Indian, 1: Asian, 2: African), current adaptive margin, and bias or the skewness
    between the race group and Caucasians. A DQN was used as a policy network that
    performed three actions (staying the same, shifting to a larger value, and shifting
    to a smaller value) to change the adaptive margin, and accepted reward in form
    of change in the sum of inter-class and intra-class bias.'

    ability in eliminating uninformative parts of the input to leverage the other
    parts having a more useful information. Recently, attention mechanism has been
    integrated into typical CNN models at every individual layer to strengthen the
    intermediate outputs of each layer, in turn improving the final predictions for
    recognition in images. This model is usually trained with a weakly supervised
    method, however, this optimization method may lead to sub-optimal weights in the

    computer vision applications including landmark detection, object detection, object
    tracking, image registration, image segmentation, video analysis, and other computer
    vision applications. DRL has also demonstrated to be an effective alternative
    for solving difficult optimization problems, including tuning parameters, selecting
    augmentation strategies, and neural architecture search (NAS). However, most approaches,
    that we have reviewed, assume a stationary environment, from which observations
    are made. Take landmark detection as an instance, the environment takes into account
    the image itself, and each state is defined as an image patch consisting of the
    landmark location. In such a case, the environment is known while the RL/DRL framework
    naturally accommodates a dynamic environment, that is the environment itself evolves
    with the state and action. Realizing the full potential of DRL for computer vision
    requires solving several challenges. In this section, we would like to discuss
    the challenges of DRL in computer vision for real-world systems.

    function is clearly defined. However, this is limited in real-world applications
    because it requires knowledge from different domains that may not always be available.
    Inverse DRL is one of the special cases of imitation learning. An example is autonomous
    driving, the reward function should be based on all factors such as driver’s behavior,
    gas consumption, time, speed, safety, driving quality, etc. In real-world scenario,
    it is exhausting and hard to control all these factors. Different from DRL, inverse
    DRL [[278](#bib.bib278)], [[4](#bib.bib4)], [[413](#bib.bib413)], [[86](#bib.bib86)]
    a specific form of imitation learning [[286](#bib.bib286)], infers the reward
    function of an agent, given its policy or observed behavior, thereby avoiding
    a manual specification of its reward function. In the same problem of autonomous
    driving, inverse RL first uses a dataset collected from the human-generated driving
    and then approximates the reward function. Inverse RL has been successfully applied
    to many domains [[4](#bib.bib4)]. Recently, to analyze complex human movement
    and control high-dimensional robot systems, [[215](#bib.bib215)] proposed an online
    inverse RL algorithm. [[2](#bib.bib2)] combined both RL and Inverse RL to address
    planning problems in autonomous driving.'

    stock trading [[206](#bib.bib206)], social science [[207](#bib.bib207)], etc.,
    involve multiple players that requires a model with multi-agent. Take autonomous
    driving as an instance, multi-agent DRL addresses the sequential decision-making
    problem which involves many autonomous agents, each of which aims to optimize
    its own utility return by interacting with the environment and other agents [[40](#bib.bib40)].
    Learning in a multi-agent scenario is more difficult than a single-agent scenario
    because non-stationarity [[135](#bib.bib135)], multi-dimensionality [[40](#bib.bib40)],
    credit assignment [[5](#bib.bib5)], etc., depend on the multi-agent DRL approach
    of either fully cooperative or fully competitive. The agents can either collaborate
    to optimize a long-term utility or compete so that the utility is summed to zero.

    an artificial agent to learn closely optimal strategies by experiences. This paper
    aims to provide a state-of-the-art comprehensive survey of DRL applications to
    a variety of decision-making problems in the area of computer vision. In this
    work, we firstly provided a structured summarization of the theoretical foundations
    in Deep Learning (DL) including AutoEncoder (AE), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We then
    continued to introduce key techniques in RL research including model-based methods
    (value functions, transaction models, policy search, return functions) and model-free
    methods (value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic). Main techniques in DRL
    were thirdly presented under two categories of model-based and model-free approaches.
    We fourthly surveyed the broad-ranging applications of DRL methods in solving
    problems affecting areas of computer vision, from landmark detection, object detection,
    object tracking, image registration, image segmentation, video analysis, and many
    other applications in the computer vision area. We finally discussed several challenges
    ahead of us in order to realize the full potential of DRL for computer vision.
    Some latest advanced DRL techniques were included in the last discussion.
