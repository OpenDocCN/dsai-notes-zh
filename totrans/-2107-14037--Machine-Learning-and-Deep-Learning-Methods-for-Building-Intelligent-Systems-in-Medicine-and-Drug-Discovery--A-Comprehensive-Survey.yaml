- en: With the advancements in computer technology, there is a rapid development of
    intelligent systems to understand the complex relationships in data to make predictions
    and classifications. Artificail Intelligence based framework is rapidly revolutionizing
    the healthcare industry. These intelligent systems are built with machine learning
    and deep learning based robust models for early diagnosis of diseases and demonstrates
    a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors and
    surgeons. Machine Learning and Deep Learning based systems can streamline and
    simplify the steps involved in diagnosis of diseases from clinical and image-based
    data, thus providing significant clinician support and workflow optimization.
    They mimic human cognition and are even capable of diagnosing diseases that cannot
    be diagnosed with human intelligence. This paper focuses on the survey of machine
    learning and deep learning applications in across 16 medical specialties, namely
    Dental medicine, Haematology, Surgery, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Orthopedics, Radiology,
    Oncology, General medicine, Psychiatry, Endocrinology, Neurology, Dermatology,
    Hepatology, Nephrology, Ophthalmology, and Drug discovery. In this paper along
    with the survey, we discuss the advancements of medical practices with these systems
    and also the impact of these systems on medical professionals.

    and classifications on the given data. The machine learning models are categorized
    into two types based on the type of learning techniques namely supervised and
    unsupervised [[6](#bib.bib6)]. In supervised learning [[105](#bib.bib105)], the
    machine learning model is trained with a set of input data (or features) that
    are associated with known output. Once the training of the machine learning model
    is successful, it is capable of making predictions on the new data. The predictions
    made by the supervised-learning algorithms can be continuous or discrete. Some
    of the examples of supervised learning algorithms are random forests, decision
    trees, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines [[67](#bib.bib67),
    [113](#bib.bib113), [76](#bib.bib76), [71](#bib.bib71)]. These techniques are
    used for diagnosing diseases like diabetes, thyroid, diabetic retinopathy, cardiomyopathy,
    etc. On the other hand, unsupervised techniques operate on input data without
    any labels(or outcomes). The main goal of these algorithms is to identify the
    undefined patterns in the unlabeled dataset. These techniques are mainly used
    for reducing the dimensions of the dataset by extracting important features from
    the data. By reducing the number of features, issues like high computational cost
    and multicollinearity can be avoided [[26](#bib.bib26)]. Some of the most commonly
    used unsupervised learning algorithms are latent Dirichlet analysis and principal
    component analysis.

    models are successful in solving problems related to image classification and
    natural language processing. These deep learning algorithms [[53](#bib.bib53)]
    are based on neural networks, these networks have multiple layers for extracting
    high-level features and for eliminating problematic features, so the performance
    of deep learning algorithms is higher than machine learning algorithms. Some of
    the widely used deep learning architectures [[104](#bib.bib104)] are Convolutional
    Neural Networks(CNN), Recurrent neural networks(RNN), and generative adversarial
    neural networks(GAN). Convolutional neural networks [[4](#bib.bib4)][ are mostly
    used for solving computer vision and image classification tasks. CNN’s reduce
    the number of parameters compared to fully connected neural networks. Convolutional
    neural networks are used for organ segmentation, identification of tumors, classification
    of various cancers from radiology images. The basic structure of CNN for classification
    and segmentation are shown in Figure [2](#S1.F2 "Fig. 2 ‣ 1.2 Deep learning ‣

    have the same statistics as the training data. GAN’s learn with an adversarial
    competition between its discriminator and generator. GAN’s are used mainly for

    dental diseases. [[87](#bib.bib87)] used machine learning approaches to classify
    three different diseases, namely dental caries, periodical infection, and periodontitis.
    The authors considered a dataset of 251 radio videography (RVG) x-ray images for
    classification, out of which 80 images are of dental caries, 110 images are of
    periodical infection, and 61 images of periodontitis. Three models were built
    they are Convolutional neural network(CNN), transfer learning of CNN with VGG16
    as a feature extractor, and CNN transfer learning model with fine-tuning. A fuzzy
    rule-based model is designed by [[116](#bib.bib116)] to diagnose dental diseases.
    In this model, different methods are used for feature extraction; they are entropy,
    edge-value, intensity, and local binary patterns, gradient feature, red-green-blue,
    and patch level feature. These extracted features are used to make a database.
    For this work, Fuzzy c-means clustering and Mamdani’s fuzzy interface methods
    were used. Machine learning algorithms are used by [[119](#bib.bib119)] for optimizing
    the dental milling process. In this paper, two models of feedforward networks
    were designed with Bayesian regularisation and early stopping technique. The artificial
    neural network structure of a feedforward network built using Bayesian regularisation
    has two layers, the first layer with 5 hyperbolic target units and the second
    layer with 30 hidden hyperbolic target units and one output unit. The structure
    of the second feedforward network built using the early stopping technique has
    the same layers as the first model, but these two networks are estimated separately
    using the Lenvenberg-Marquardt method and quasi-Newton methods. The performance
    of these models is shown Table 1.

    Machine learning techniques are used by Haematologists to diagnose diseases accurately
    in less time. [[78](#bib.bib78)] used machine learning classification techniques
    to build a model that automates the differential blood counting system. The segmentation
    of images is done using contour models, namely snakes and balloons. Texture and
    shape-based features are considered for classification. Four machine learning
    classifiers are used for classification; they are K-Nearest Neighbour, Linear
    vector quantization, Multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine. The accuracies
    of the classifiers are shown in table LABEL:tb2. The application of machine learning
    for the segmentation and tracking of thrombus is proposed by [[85](#bib.bib85)].
    Adaboost and Decision tree models are used for segmentation, and the K-nearest
    neighbor algorithm is used for tracking. These classification algorithms are evaluated
    based on the Dice coefficient, and positive predictive value and tracking method
    are evaluated based on the Dice coefficient. The classification of sickle cell
    disease using machine learning is proposed by [[46](#bib.bib46)]. For this work,
    the performances of various machine learning algorithms are analyzed, as mentioned
    in table 2, from which Levenberg-Marquardt and random forest algorithms produced
    excellent results.

    planning and as a navigation system for many of the critical surgeries. For understanding
    the functioning of knee implants after the Surgery, [[49](#bib.bib49)] used machine
    learning techniques for building a statistical model. The mapping function of
    the proposed model in this paper is built using the pre and post-operative features,
    which are extracted using Principle component analysis from the clinical database.
    The evaluation results are shown in Table 3. Minimal invasive surgeries are being
    performed by surgeons to avoid complications during the surgery and to reduce
    patient’s recovery time. Most of the minimally invasive surgeries are operated
    using robots. For avoiding the tremors during the procedure while operating with
    robots, [[60](#bib.bib60)] presented a method for attenuating the tremors using
    machine learning. The proposed method is based on optimizing parameters using
    particle swarm optimization technique and building a hybrid support vector machine
    with an integrated kernel to attenuate tremors. Stapedotomy is a surgical procedure
    performed to improve hearing, which requires the estimation of the thickness of
    the stapes bone, which is usually done by drilling a hole through the bone. [[44](#bib.bib44)]
    used machine learning techniques for the estimation of thickness. For the estimation,
    the author used a machine learning scheme known as Fuzzy Lattice Neurocomputing.
    In complex trauma surgeries, the surgeons are using augmented reality to understand
    the relationship between anatomy, tools, and implants. Olivier [[84](#bib.bib84)]
    proposed a model to improve surgical scene understanding using augmented reality.
    For this work, the random forest was used to identify objects in the scene, and
    the pixel-wise alpha map was created using an object-specific lookup table for
    image fusion. The data for this model is obtained from the C- arm devices with
    the Kinect RGB-Depth sensor. [[70](#bib.bib70)] used machine learning algorithms
    like K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and perceptron algorithm with uneven margins
    to classify semi-structured and unstructured pathology reports. He highlighted
    that the K-nearest neighbor algorithm built with binary occurrence type word vector,
    stop word filter, and pruning produced high accuracy in classifying semi-structured
    reports.

- en: Cardiovascular diseases are life-threatening diseases that require a high degree
    of accuracy and precision for their diagnosis. Machine learning has increased
    the rate of accuracy in diagnosing diseases. [[40](#bib.bib40)] described the
    use of machine learning to monitor patients having cardiovascular diseases. The
    application of Deep neural networks to detect myocardial infarction(heart attack)
    from Electrocardiogram(ECG) signals was proposed by [[1](#bib.bib1)]. The neural
    network used for this work consists of 11 convolution layers out of which six
    layers are activated by Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU) activation function, and the
    last layer is activated with soft-max function, the pooling function used is Max-pooling.
    The evaluation of results is done for both noisy and noiseless beat signals in
    the dataset. A novel approach was proposed by Peshala [[110](#bib.bib110)] to
    detect heart failure with preserved ejection fraction by using a statistical model
    along with a supervised algorithm. The data for this work is preprocessed by using
    the KNNimpute approach, and three principal component analysis models were built
    for the spatiotemporal representation of rest and exercise, and distance weighted
    nearest neighbor algorithm is used for the diagnosis. A comparative analysis was
    performed by [[5](#bib.bib5)] in using machine learning network structures to
    diagnose diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. According to this analysis, the
    network built using the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm(LMLA) and Naive
    Bayesian network achieved better accuracy compared with other proposed models
    considered from 2008 to 2017. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy(HCM) is a chronic heart
    disease that leads to the thickening of the heart muscle and restricts the flow
    of blood. [[91](#bib.bib91)] proposed a methodology to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
    from 10 seconds, 12-lead electrocardiogram(ECG) signals. For this work, features
    are selected using information gain criterion, and random forest, and support
    vector machines are used for diagnosis. The application of machine learning techniques
    to diagnose heart disease in patients is proposed by [[25](#bib.bib25)]. The data
    for this work is preprocessed to make it suitable for classification. A set of
    five machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, gradient
    boosting, support vector machine, and naive Bayes are used to make classification’s
    on the data. The accuracies of these classifiers are mentioned in table 4, out
    of which logistic regression has maximum accuracy. An ensemble learning methodology
    was proposed by [[22](#bib.bib22)] to diagnose heart diseases. This methodology
    is based on the ensemble voting of Logistic Regression, artificial neural network,
    Gaussian naïve Bayes, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. Their
    model achieved an accuracy of 89$\%$, precision of 91.6$\%$, sensitivity of 86$\%$,
    and specificity of 91$\%$. Atherosclerosis is the primary factor for cardiovascular
    diseases like a heart attack. A novel methodology was proposed by [[127](#bib.bib127)],
    which focuses on the detection of risk factors from the different stages of carotid
    atherosclerosis that are leading to cardiovascular diseases. This method focuses
    on the use of a decision tree algorithm with a neural network, logistic regression,
    and support vector machine for making accurate predictions. Seismocardiographic
    signals are used to study cardiopulmonary interactions. [[31](#bib.bib31)] used
    k-means clustering along with a time-domain amplitude feature to cluster Seismocardiographic
    signals. Single-photon emission computed tomography(SPET) imaging is a nuclear
    imaging technique used to capture the functioning of the heart using gamma rays.
    [[14](#bib.bib14)] used machine learning to combine clinical information and SPET
    imaging data to predict major adverse cardiac events(MACE). The use of machine
    learning for rehabilitation assessment is proposed by [[88](#bib.bib88)]. Thermal
    and heart rate data is processed, and the Neural network with sigmoidal and probabilistic
    transfer function is used for the assessment.

- en: Respiratory diseases are very complex diseases that affect not only the lungs
    but also the other organs of the body. Predicting these diseases in advance can
    reduce the complications while treating these diseases. Many studies are performed
    by researchers in diagnosing respiratory diseases by using machine learning techniques.
    Acute diseases like Respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) is diagnosed using machine
    learning by [[92](#bib.bib92)]. For this work, four different versions of the
    Support vector machine were built. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated
    based on accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve
    shown in table 5. Audio auscultation is the primary examination that a specialist
    performs when he sees a patient. Audio auscultation is considered to be the best
    primary practice to detect abnormalities in the heart and lungs. An approach was
    performed by [[18](#bib.bib18)] to detect respiratory diseases using audio auscultation.
    In this approach, the automatic free sound extractor was used to extract features
    from the ICBHI-2017 challenge database, and a boosted decision tree algorithm
    is used to detect sounds with respiratory diseases. A study was performed by [[80](#bib.bib80)]
    in diagnosing respiratory pathologies from pulmonary acoustic signals using support
    vector machine and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. A comparative study was performed
    by [[93](#bib.bib93)] to detect obstructive sleep apnoea by using electrocardiogram
    derived respiratory signal(EDR) and respiratory chest signals. Three models, namely
    Support Vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and extreme learning machine
    was built. These three models diagnosed the disease with high accuracy when they
    are trained with respiratory chest signals. Seismocardiogram cycles were used
    to identify respiratory phases like inspiration and expiration using machine learning
    by [[131](#bib.bib131)]. For building, this model support vector machine was employed
    and trained with the 50 percent data approved by healthcare authorities of British
    Columbia. A novel methodology named FissureNet was proposed by [[33](#bib.bib33)]
    to detect pulmonary fissure from computed tomography(CT) images. This FissureNet
    is a source of a fine cascade of two Seg3DNet neural network algorithms. The proposed
    methodology achieved higher accuracy when compared to models built with U-Net
    architecture and Hessian matrix.

    machine learning. A methodology was proposed by [[48](#bib.bib48)] for the risk
    assessment of osteoporosis. In this methodology, the Support Vector machine is
    used for risk assessment, and this method was tested on the Korean government’s
    Survey’s dataset. The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis from X-ray images was
    proposed by [[66](#bib.bib66)]. Support Vector Machine, along with a histogram
    of oriented gradients, is used for the diagnosis. The accuracy of the model detecting
    finger joints, erosion estimation, and Joint space narrowing(JSN) is shown in
    table 6. The assessment of bone density from x-ray images was proposed by [[15](#bib.bib15)].
    In the proposed methodology, the traditional GoogleNet convolutional neural network
    was modified by adding large number filters with a multilayer perceptron. This
    modified neural network produced better results than the traditional neural network.

    Machine learning algorithms were used by [[55](#bib.bib55)] for gating and tracking
    of lung cancer tumors. In this work, Principle component analysis and neural network
    with backpropagation algorithm are used for gating, and an artificial neural network
    is used for tracking. The results are shown in Table 7. [[112](#bib.bib112)] compared
    the performance of three convolutional neural network architectures namely GoogleNet,
    InceptionV3, and ResNet50 to detect abnormalities in a chest x-ray. For this work,
    the images from the Stanford Normal Radiology Diagnostic Dataset are used and
    are preprocessed using histogram equalization before training the CNN models.
    Detecting fractured bones from x-ray images was proposed by [[17](#bib.bib17)].
    For this work, many types of features were fused for building a stacked random
    forest model to detect the fractures of bones. This stacked random forest showed
    enhanced performance compared to the support vector machine. Machine learning
    classifiers and active learning methods are used by [[74](#bib.bib74)], to classify
    radiology reports. In this work, four active learning methods like Self-Confident,
    Simple, Balance EE, and Kernel Farthest-First are analyzed to enhance the performance
    of the Support vector machine classifier for the classification of reports. The
    rule-based preprocessing method is used to preprocess the data. A study was performed
    by [[123](#bib.bib123)] on using machine learning for the classification of Malignant
    and Benign microcalcifications. In this work, five different machine learning
    and deep learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine, Kernel Fisher Discriminant,
    Relevance Vector Machines, Feed Forward Neural Network, and Ada Boost, were studied
    and their performances were evaluated. The performances of the classifiers are
    described in table 7. [[126](#bib.bib126)] used machine-learning to detect breast
    cancer from mammogram images. For this approach, a three-layered feedforward neural
    network with a backpropagation algorithm was built to detect breast cancer. This
    neural network is trained on features extracted from mammograms by experienced
    radiologists. Abnormalities from orthopedic trauma radiographs are diagnosed using
    neural network approaches by Jakub [[77](#bib.bib77)]. Five freely available networks
    from the Caffe library are considered, and they are retrained with 13 epochs.
    The performance of all the networks are similar and exhibited an accuracy of 90

    medicine is shown in Table 9\. A machine learning approach was proposed by [t74]
    to improve the performance of computer-based diagnosis systems. For this purpose,
    a semi-supervised learning algorithm named co-Forest was used. [[68](#bib.bib68)]
    proposed a model to diagnose fever. This model was build using the Naive Bayes
    algorithm with Dempster Shafer theory. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is a fatal disease
    that was found mostly in the southern parts of Asia. For estimating the risk level
    of this disease, a machine learning model was proposed by [[69](#bib.bib69)].
    The risk level of the disease is predicted using an extreme learning machine.
    For avoiding aspiration pneumonia, a swallowing assessment model was developed
    using machine learning techniques by [[41](#bib.bib41)]. The features are extracted
    using linear predictive coding, and a support vector machine is used to classify
    patients with dysphagia. Convolutional neural networks were used by [[54](#bib.bib54)]
    to diagnose malaria. The performance of the neural network is superior to the
    performance of the support vector machine.

    features, and a fully connected neural network was used for diagnosis. Convolutional
    neural networks performed better than other existing algorithms for diagnosis.
    Many cancer-related deaths in men are due to prostate cancer. A neural network
    model was developed by [[115](#bib.bib115)] to detect prostate cancers from multi-parametric
    MRI scan images. This convolutional neural network has 5 convolutional layers,
    and it is evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve. Machine learning and
    deep learning techniques are applied to classify cancerous profiles by [[101](#bib.bib101)]
    For this work, a feedforward neural network with a backpropagation algorithm and
    support vector machine is used for clustering and classification of data. Neural
    network approaches were used by [[10](#bib.bib10)] to detect lung cancer from
    chest x-ray images. For this work, 121 layered neural network and transfer learning
    methods are employed for building the model. The performance of the model over
    three different datasets are shown in Table 8. The waiting times of patients in
    radiational oncology were predicted using machine learning techniques by [[42](#bib.bib42)].
    For this study, a set of four different algorithms, namely, support vector machine,
    linear regression, random forest, and decision tree, were analyzed. Random Forest
    algorithm performed best when compared to the remaining three algorithms.

- en: Psychiatric disorders are common health problems with which millions of people
    are suffering around the world. Machine learning and deep learning helps to diagnose
    problems like depression based on data from many sources. The models surveyed
    to diagnose psychiatric disorders are shown in Table 10. An approach was proposed
    by [[125](#bib.bib125)] to classify people with depression based on the data from
    social networking sites. A multilayer neural network was used for the classification
    of users with depression from social network data. Another methodology was proposed
    by [[9](#bib.bib9)] to classify depression using deep learning. For this method,
    the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for feature extraction, and
    Meta Cognitive neural network with projection-based learning is used for classification.
    A study was performed by [[94](#bib.bib94)] to diagnose depression using machine
    learning in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients. For this study, four machine learning
    algorithms, namely the K-means, Fuzzy C-mean, probabilistic neural network, and
    support vector machine, were built. The performance of the Support vector machine
    is better compared to the remaining algorithms. For the detection of stress, a
    machine learning framework was proposed by [[109](#bib.bib109)]. Stress at different
    levels was diagnosed from Electrocardiogram signals using a logistic regression
    model. Psychiatric disorders are found in newborn babies, which were inherited
    from their depressed parents. A study was performed by [[56](#bib.bib56)] to detect
    familiar depression in patients from MRI scans using machine learning and deep
    learning. In this study, logistic regression, graph convolutional neural network,
    and Support vector machine were analyzed. Various machine learning algorithms
    were compared by [[96](#bib.bib96)] to diagnose depression and anxiety among patients.
    Five different classifiers, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost,
    Naive Bayes, and Support Vector machine, were evaluated. A comprehensive survey
    was performed by [[82](#bib.bib82)] on using machine learning to build systems
    that detect mental stress. In this Survey, popular feature selection methods are
    discussed. A comparative study was performed by [[32](#bib.bib32)] on using random
    forest and neural networks to classify depression in patients based on motor activity.
    The performance of random forest is better when compared to the neural network.
    A hybrid model was developed by [[39](#bib.bib39)] to predict the emotional state
    of learners from brain waves using machine learning techniques. WEKA software
    is used for this approach, and the emotional states were predicted using the K-nearest
    neighbor algorithm.

    using machine learning. For this approach, a random forest classifier was used,
    and its performance was superior compared with logistic regression and support

    mellitus using a support vector machine. For this study, linear and non-linear
    support vector machines were analyzed and tested on a standard dataset from the
    UCI repository. A study was performed by [[3](#bib.bib3)] on using machine learning
    for preemptive diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. In this study, four machine learning
    algorithms, namely naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and
    neural network, were analyzed. Artificial neural networks outperformed all the
    remaining three classifiers. Using a Support vector machine with radial bias function(RBF)
    kernel for diagnosing diabetes mellitus was proposed by [[12](#bib.bib12)]. For
    this work, the data is sampled using a K-means clustering algorithm. An approach
    was proposed by [[111](#bib.bib111)] to predict the rate of re-admission of diabetes
    mellitus patients at the hospital. C.45 algorithm is used for prediction on a
    standard dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.

    network with Radial based function(RBF) kernel, artificial immune recognition
    system, Learning Vector Quantization, and feedforward network with backpropagation
    algorithm. The performance of these models is shown in table 12. Classifying the

    vector machine classifier is used to make classifications on the real-time data
    obtained from the UCI repository and a well-known hospital in Pakistan. The segmentation
    and classification of thyroid images from ultrasound scans were proposed by [[98](#bib.bib98)].
    For this model, the Extreme learning machine and support vector machine is used
    for segmentation and classification of ultrasound images. The performance of these
    models is shown in Table 12.

    neurological disorders at an early stage. The performance of the models used to
    diagnose neurological disorders is shown in Table 13. The diagnosis of chronic
    diseases like schizophrenia from MRI scans was proposed by [[75](#bib.bib75)].
    For this approach, the Boruta algorithm is used for feature selection, and various
    machine learning algorithms were built, namely Support vector machine, Linear
    discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, C5.0 Decision tree, Gaussian
    process classifier, and random forest. A method was proposed by [[132](#bib.bib132)]
    to classify normal and abnormal brain Computed Tomography(CT) scan images. The
    features for this approach were extracted based on greyscale, shape and texture,
    symmetric features. See5 and Neural network with radial bias function was built
    based on these features. Cerebral microbleeds are chronic brain hemorrhages that
    lead to the death of a person. The diagnosis of cerebral microbleeds from Susceptibility
    weighted imaging(SWI) scans using deep learning was proposed by [[59](#bib.bib59)].
    Eight layered Convolutional neural network model was built and trained with 8000
    images for diagnosis. An approach was proposed by [[23](#bib.bib23)] to recognize
    and anticipate the seriousness of tremor and dyskinesia using machine learning
    and deep learning methods. For this work three models namely the hidden Markov
    model, support vector machines, and neural networks, were built for the detection
    of tremors and dyskinesia. The seriousness of tremor and dyskinesia was anticipated
    using the Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier. A diagnostic approach for dementia
    and mild cognitive impairment using machine learning was proposed by Daniel [[107](#bib.bib107)].
    For this approach three models namely extreme gradient boosting, stochastic gradient
    boosting, and the random forest was built using the features extracted by the
    RelieF method. A two-step approach for classifying Parkinson’s disease gait was
    proposed by [[121](#bib.bib121)]. In this approach, the first step is to normalize
    the data using a multi regression approach, and the second step is classification
    using random forest. The performance of this approach is superior to the performance
    of the support vector machine and kernel Fisher discriminant. The detection of
    epileptic convulsions from accelerometric signals using machine learning was proposed
    by [[65](#bib.bib65)]. For this work, the classification of seizure and non-seizure
    epochs is done using the least-square support vector machine. The data for this
    work is collected from the patients using four accelerometers tied to their wrists
    and ankles. [[29](#bib.bib29)] proposed a neural network model for the assessment
    of Parkinson’s disease. For this work convolutional neural network with a rectified
    linear unit(ReLU) activation function was built, and it showed better performance
    compared to K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, AdaBoost, and partial
    decision tree. Bradykinesia is an important factor in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s
    disease. A method was proposed by [[63](#bib.bib63)] to predict the scores of
    each patient based on their moments using a support vector machine. Movements
    like finger tapping, diadochokinesis, and toe-tapping were considered. Classifying
    neurological gait disorders like Parkinson’s disease and stroke using multi-task
    feature learning was proposed by [[83](#bib.bib83)]. For building this multi-task
    feature learning method, a support vector machine and neural network were used.
    The segmentation of glioblastomas from brain MRI scans was proposed by [[43](#bib.bib43)].
    The proposed method focuses on replacing manual segmentation of brain MRI scans
    with automated segmentation using machine learning. In this approach, segmentation
    is done using K-means clustering, and the segmentation accuracy of this model
    is better than the accuracy of manual segmentation. The detection of chronic traumatic
    Encephalopathy using machine learning was proposed by [[58](#bib.bib58)]. For
    this work, Random classifier, Random Forest, Support vector machine(RBF kernel),
    and K-nearest neighbor, were built. These models were trained with data from two
    sequences, namely PRESS and L-COSY of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The accuracy
    of the classifiers is better when they are trained with L-COSY.

- en: The diagnosis of dermatological diseases using machine learning and deep learning
    was proposed by [[50](#bib.bib50)]. Three machine learning models, namely neural
    networks, decision tree, and an nth nearest neighbor were built and trained using
    a standard dataset. An approach was performed by [[8](#bib.bib8)] to diagnose
    skin diseases from colored images using artificial neural networks. Various methods,
    like image cropping and color gradient generation, are applied to preprocess the
    data. A feedforward neural network with a backpropagation algorithm was used for
    diagnosis. The segmentation of skin ulcer images using machine learning was proposed
    by [[97](#bib.bib97)]. In this study, several models like Extreme learning machine,
    J48, Support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, Multilayer perceptron,
    and Naive Bayes were analyzed. The performance of these algorithms in the segmentation
    of ulcers is shown in table 14. A survey was performed by [[37](#bib.bib37)] on
    using machine learning algorithms for classifying skin diseases based on color
    and texture features. For this survey, skin diseases, namely Eczema, Lichen plants,
    and plague psoriasis, were diagnosed using linear discriminant analysis, artificial
    neural networks, naive Bayes, and support vector machine. A novel method was proposed
    by [[51](#bib.bib51)] to diagnose erythematosquamous diseases using ensemble modeling.
    Support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms
    were built using the features extracted based on rough set theory. The results
    of these algorithms were combined using the majority voting method(Ensemble method).
    The diagnosis of diseases, namely melanocytes nevus, seborrheic keratosis, basal
    cell carcinoma, and psoriasis using neural network approaches were proposed by
    [[133](#bib.bib133)]. In this approach, transfer learning of GoogleNet InceptionV3
    is used for diagnosis. For this approach, two different datasets with the same
    diseases and features were used to train the model. The early diagnosis of skin
    tumors is possible by estimating the constituent elements of the skin. An approach
    was proposed by [[120](#bib.bib120)] to estimate the skin elements using machine
    learning. The support vector regressor model was used for estimating skin constituents.

    stage of liver fibrosis in patients suffering from Hepatitis C was performed by
    [[36](#bib.bib36)]. In this study, five machine learning algorithms were analyzed,
    namely alternating decision tree, particle swarm optimization, multi-linear regression,
    alternating decision tree with criterion point zero, and genetic algorithm. An
    approach was proposed by [[73](#bib.bib73)] to diagnose liver fibrosis from liver
    biopsies using machine learning and search algorithms. In this approach, Related
    Objects, Skipper algorithm is used to query the database, and a rule-based subsumption
    algorithm is used for diagnosis. Predicting the stage of liver fibrosis is essential
    for the treatment of the disease. [[11](#bib.bib11)] proposed a methodology to
    predict the stage of liver fibrosis using machine learning. In this methodology,
    liver fibrosis is classified into five stages using a decision tree algorithm.
    A methodology was proposed by [[16](#bib.bib16)] for predicting the stage of fibrosis
    and inflammatory activity from serum indices data of Hepatitis C patients using
    the Extreme learning machine algorithm.

    by [[19](#bib.bib19)]. For this work, four machine learning algorithms, namely
    support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and logistic regression,
    were explored to find the best classifier. The support vector machine was found
    to be the best classifier. A methodology for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease
    using a support vector machine was proposed by [120]. For this work, the features
    are selected based on the standard deviation of data. A model was proposed by
    [[124](#bib.bib124)] to suggest the best diet plan for chronic kidney disease
    patients using machine learning. The best diet plan is recommended by this system
    by predicting the potassium zone of the patient. This experiment is carried out
    by various multi-class classifiers, namely decision tree, decision jungle, logistic
    regression, and neural network. Better performance was found in the decision tree.
    The surveyed models are tabulated in Table 16.

    Pharma industry. [[79](#bib.bib79)] used machine learning for drug design. For
    this work, the prediction of inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase from pyrimidines
    is made using a support vector machine. The data for this research is taken from
    the University of California Irvine(UCI) machine learning repository. In this
    paper, the performance of Support Vector Machine is compared with the Prune network,
    multilayer perceptron(MLP) feedforward network, radial bias function network(RBF),
    dynamic network, and C5.0\. The support vector machine performed best among the
    above algorithms with a training time of 93 seconds. Machine learning is used
    by [[86](#bib.bib86)] to predict proximal tubular toxicity in humans. For this
    work, the researchers developed a one-step protocol to differentiate human induced
    pluripotent stem cells(hiPCS) into proximal tubular like cells. A random forest
    algorithm is used for prediction. This algorithm is evaluated based on sensitivity,
    specificity, and accuracy and is shown in table 18. Drug likeliness is predicted
    using machine learning by [[47](#bib.bib47)]. In this work, Bayesian classifier,
    recursive portioning models were developed to predict the drug likeliness, and
    these models are evaluated based on the compounds from the Traditional Chinese
    medicine compound database(TCMCD). Bayesian classifier with the LCFP_6 fingerprint
    set and physicochemical properties outperformed the Recursive partitioning model.
    A study was performed by [[118](#bib.bib118)] on using machine learning and deep
    learning techniques in drug discovey. In this paper the authors surveyed the different
    machine learning and deep learning models that were used in target identification
    and validation, design and optimization of small molecules, discovery of biomarkers,
    prediction of drug sensitivity and in computational pathology.

    of seven convolutional neural networks(CNN). This COVIDX-Net model diagnosed COVID-19
    infection from x-ray images with an F1-score of 0.91\. A deep learning open source
    model named COVID-Net was proposed by [[122](#bib.bib122)] to diagnose COVID-19\.
    This model was able to classify the x-ray images into three classes namely normal,
    Pneumonia, and COVID-19 with an accuracy of 92$\%$. [[7](#bib.bib7)] performed
    a comparative study on using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures namely
    VGG19, MobileNet, Xception, Inception, and Inception ResNet v2 for the diagnosis
    of COVID-19\. According to this study, VGG19 and MobileNet showed enhanced performance
    compared to the other models with an accuracy of 98.75$\%$ and 97.40$\%$. Another
    comparative study was performed by [[72](#bib.bib72)] on using ResNet50, ResNet152,
    ResNet101, Inception-ResNetV2 and InceptionV3 to diagnose COVID-19 from chest
    x-ray images of three different datasets. According to this study, it was observed
    that ResNet50 performed better than other models with the accuracies of 96.1$\%$,
    99.5$\%$, and 99.7$\%$ on all the three datasets. [[100](#bib.bib100)] diagnosed

    diagnosis system known as DeepPneumonia to diagnose COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia.
    In this work, the authors used data collected from 86 healthy persons, 101 patients
    diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, and 88 patients diagnosed with COVID-19\.
    This data was collected from 19 hospitals in China. This model was tested with
    images from two datasets. [[134](#bib.bib134)] developed a weakly-supervised deep
    learning model for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest CT images. In this work,
    a pre-trained U-Net architecture is used to segment the lung region from the image
    and a 3D deep neural network was used to diagnose the COVID-19 infection in the
    lungs. This system is very fast at it takes only 1.93s to process a CT image of
    a patient and diagnoses the disease with an accuracy of 90.1$\%$ and specificity
    of 91.1$\%$. [[129](#bib.bib129)] proposed a methodology to diagnose COVID-19
    pneumonia and Influenza-A viral pneumonia. In this methodology, a 3D CNN model
    is used to segment the candidate regions in the lungs and a location-attention
    classifier is used to classify these regions into COVID-19 pneumonia, influenza-A
    viral pneumonia and as normal and finally, a noisy or Bayesian function is used
    to calculate the infection probability. [[13](#bib.bib13)] performed a study on
    using a support vector machine as a classifier trained with features extracted
    using five different algorithms for the diagnosis of COVID-19 CT images. The five
    feature extraction algorithms that were used in this work are Local Directional
    Pattern(LDP), Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix
    (GLSZM), Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), and Discrete Wavelet Transform
    (DWT). According to this study support vector machine trained with features extracted
    using the GLSZM algorithm performed better than other feature extraction algorithms
    with an accuracy of 99.68$\%$. [[61](#bib.bib61)] proposed a methodology to diagnose
    COVID-19 using multi-level thresholding and a support vector machine. [[21](#bib.bib21)]
    designed a deep learning model using transfer learning UNet for the diagnosis
    of COVID-19\. For this work, 46,096 anonymous CT images are collected from 106
    patients admitted to Renmin hospital in Wuhan city were used, out of which 51
    patients are diagnosed with COVID-19\. [[81](#bib.bib81)] proposed a transfer
    learning model by fine-tuning the pre-trained model VGG16 for the diagnosis of
    COVID-19\. [[90](#bib.bib90)] compared two deep learning models that were built
    using the transfer learning of residual networks ResNet34 and ResNet50 for the
    diagnosis of pneumonia and COVID-19\. According to this paper, ResNet50 performed
    better than ResNet32 with an accuracy of 72.38$\%$. [[103](#bib.bib103)] proposed

    decision making is the only way for diagnosing diseases. This may sometimes lead
    to unreliable diagnosis due to bias in human decisions. Smart intelligent techniques
    like ML and DL methodologies can be used to improve reliability in diagnosis thereby
    saving lot of human lives. Thus researchers started proposing various models for
    automating diagnosis in healthcare in various specializations including Orthopedics(
    estimating bone density, diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis), Radiology( interpreting
    mammography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans), Ophthalmology(
    diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma), Cardiology( diagnosis
    of complex diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and many more. Such diagnosis
    may help saving lives of human. For eg., according to a study performed by the
    American Cancer Society [[28](#bib.bib28)] it was found that more than 50$\%$
    of the women who are getting annual mammograms over 10 years are having false-positive
    findings. These false-positive findings in mammograms can lead to unnecessary
    examinations like ultrasound scans, MRI, and even biopsies and this can be avoided
    by using ML and DL based systems.

- en: Machine learning and deep learning are playing a key role in all stages of drug
    discovery. These techniques are used extensively for better understanding of disease
    mechanisms, non-disease and disease phenotypes, to identify novel targets and
    in development of biomarkers for drug efficiency and prognosis. These systems
    are becoming more effective than medical professionals in terms of diagnosis and
    predictive analysis of diseases [[89](#bib.bib89), [57](#bib.bib57)]. This led
    to a major concern that these systems will replace medical professionals in near
    future, especially radiologists. The main reason for this concern is its ability
    to learn from millions of images and this learning enables the computer systems
    to diagnose the most complex diseases that are difficult to be diagnosed by experienced
    medical professionals. But there are few limitations with these systems, so we
    can’t completely depend on these systems for diagnosis. But these systems can
    be a part of a radiologist’s life, by assisting them during diagnosis and making
    their work more accurate and efficient.

- en: In the case of other medical specialties, computer systems cannot be a replacement
    for doctors because these systems cannot gain trust in patients and cannot have
    high-level interactions with the patients. Even though one might say that there
    is a possibility that these systems can make clinical conversations in the future.
    But, even if computer systems are built to an extent that they can conduct real-time
    MRI, CT, and other imaging examinations and perform automated surgeries, they
    cannot replace doctors. Doctors are still needed for the diagnosis and treatment
    of novel and ambiguous cases. These computer systems under-perform in case of
    novel diseases, side effects caused by drugs because there is no prior instance
    available for these systems to learn from [[30](#bib.bib30)]. For these reasons,
    it can be concluded the smart intelligent computer systems will support doctors
    by assisting them during the diagnosis and treatment of diseases instead of replacing
    them.

- en: The diagnosis of diseases is a complex and time consuming process. The conventional
    procedures followed to diagnose diseases are not so accurate. Intelligent computer
    systems are being used by medical professionals for fast and accurate diagnosis
    of diseases. There is a lot of research that is done in this field. So the main
    aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of different machine learning
    and deep learning models that are developed and used in building computer systems
    to diagnose diseases across various specializations of medicine. Along with the
    survey, we discuss the advancements in healthcare with machine learning and deep
    learning-based systems and also the impacts of these systems on medical professionals.
    This paper provides a deep dive into the different frameworks, models and tools
    along with practical concerns and considerations in Health care domain that include
    Dental medicine, Haematology, Surgery, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Orthopedics, Radiology,
    Oncology, General medicine, Psychiatry, Endocrinology, Neurology, Dermatology,
    Hepatology, Nephrology, and Ophthalmology. Along with the medical specializations
    mentioned above, we also present the survey of machine learning and deep learning
    models in drug discovery.
