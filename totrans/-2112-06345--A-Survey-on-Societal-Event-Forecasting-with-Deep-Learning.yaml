- en: 'Population-level societal events, such as civil unrest and crime, often have
    a significant impact on our daily life. Forecasting such events is of great importance
    for decision-making and resource allocation. Event prediction has traditionally
    been challenging due to the lack of knowledge regarding the true causes and underlying
    mechanisms of event occurrence. In recent years, research on event forecasting
    has made significant progress due to two main reasons: (1) the development of
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms and (2) the accessibility of public
    data such as social media, news sources, blogs, economic indicators, and other
    meta-data sources. The explosive growth of data and the remarkable advancement
    in software/hardware technologies have led to applications of deep learning techniques
    in societal event studies. This paper is dedicated to providing a systematic and
    comprehensive overview of deep learning technologies for societal event predictions.
    We focus on two domains of societal events: civil unrest and crime. We first introduce
    how event forecasting problems are formulated as a machine learning prediction
    task. Then, we summarize data resources, traditional methods, and recent development
    of deep learning models for these problems. Finally, we discuss the challenges
    in societal event forecasting and put forward some promising directions for future
    research.'

- en: Societal events can be broadly categorized into offline events (e.g., strikes,
    protests, and robberies) and online events (e.g., activism, petitions, and hoaxes
    on online platforms (Zhao, [2021](#bib.bib158))). This paper focuses on studying
    offline societal events that occur in specific places and times and affect society
    in different ways. Understanding such events and their recurring patterns is an
    urgent issue for many stakeholders such as investors and suppliers. Different
    from retrospective studies such as event detection (Yang et al., [1998](#bib.bib146))
    and summarization (Chakrabarti and Punera, [2011](#bib.bib26)), event forecasting
    focuses on anticipating events in the future based on historical event patterns.
    Accurate prediction of future events is conducive to effective allocation of public
    resources, reducing economic loss and social damage. Generally, it can bring enormous
    benefits to society and individuals, such as effective disaster response and socio-economic
    growth. In this survey, we focus on summarizing the literature on societal event
    prediction, where events are initiated by humans and affect society on a large
    scale. Specifically, we organize related work on the prediction of civil unrest
    and criminal activities that have widespread social impacts from individuals to
    cities and nations (Braha, [2012](#bib.bib18)).

    widely studied in various fields, including civil unrest (Deng et al., [2019](#bib.bib35))
    and criminal activities (Huang et al., [2018](#bib.bib56)). In these studies,
    researchers attempt to develop predictive analytic techniques based on historical
    data of events and other relevant sources to predict future events. The methods
    studied are from a variety of fields, such as statistics, data mining, machine
    learning, and deep learning. Nowadays, the effective collection of good-quality
    data, the popularity of high-performance computing equipment (Flouris et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib40)), and the accelerated development of the field of machine learning
    and deep learning have led to substantial progress in event prediction research.
    However, there are still many challenges present in addressing this problem:'

    continues to increase, researchers have begun to resort to heterogeneous data
    to develop predictive models (Meng and Srihari, [[n.d.]](#bib.bib87); Stec and
    Klabjan, [2018](#bib.bib120); Wang et al., [2020a](#bib.bib137)). Societal events
    occur in a dynamic social environment, and their corresponding key information
    can publish in various forms, such as traditional news reports, social media,
    and government official reports. It brings unique challenges of efficiently processing
    and learning from heterogeneous data to make accurate event predictions.

    spatiotemporal dependencies of events. Traditional methodologies have shown limitations
    in modeling complex event data (Olligschlaeger, [1997](#bib.bib95); Smith et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib118)), which encourages the development of advanced models to address

    such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing,
    given its superiority in improving accuracy when trained with sufficient data.
    Recently, there has been a surge of deep learning approaches in the societal event
    domain. The purpose of this survey is to summarize deep learning technologies
    for event forecasting and to highlight the open problems and new possibilities

    et al., [2017](#bib.bib98)) provided a literature review that examines the problems
    and techniques for predictive analysis using social media data. Recently, [Zhao](#bib.bib158) (Zhao,

    prediction methods, covering challenges, techniques, applications, evaluations,
    and open problems. As event prediction methods are typically motivated by specific
    application areas, some surveys instead focus on event technologies in particular
    domains. [Ganar and Ardhapurkar](#bib.bib42) (Ganar and Ardhapurkar, [2016](#bib.bib42))
    summarized studies of civil unrest prediction in social media analysis based on
    keyword filtering. For predictive studies of crime, [Mookiah et al.](#bib.bib90) (Mookiah
    et al., [2015](#bib.bib90)) discussed crime research that considers various crime-related
    variables and examined the impact of these variables on crime prediction. [Kounadi

    and evaluation of the state-of-the-art technologies in spatial crime prediction,
    with a focus on research design and techniques. [Butt et al.](#bib.bib20) (Butt

- en: Civil unrest, also known as civil disorder, is an activity arising from a mass
    act of gathering. In such activities, participants express their protest against
    things that affect their lives and for which they assume that governments or other
    entities have a responsibility (e.g., cost of urban transportation, poor infrastructure,
    etc.). Civil unrest events include protests, strikes, and demonstrations for different
    reasons. Anticipating such events can help stakeholders (e.g., investors and suppliers)
    understand the dynamic patterns of these events and improve resource allocation.
    This section starts with the formal problem formulation of civil unrest prediction
    followed by an introduction of available data resources in this research area.
    In the following, we summarize traditional civil unrest forecasting methods and
    provide a more detailed description of advanced deep learning approaches categorized
    by the characteristics of model structures.

    learning, which aims at learning a function that maps an input to an output based
    on input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting
    of a set of training instances, where the input is historical data collected before
    the timestamp of the output variable. Before going into the problem definition
    of societal event forecasting, we first introduce the preliminaries, including
    terminologies and mathematical notations.

    and each location $l$ can be represented by a set of features used for prediction.
    We divide features into two categories, static and dynamic.¹¹1Dynamic features
    are usually involved in civil unrest prediction studies, while static features
    are sometimes not considered. Static features such as population and political
    ideology remain constant or change slowly over a long time, while dynamic features
    such as frequency of events or number of tweets expressing “angry” emotions are
    updated for each time interval $t$ (e.g., day, week). Let $\mathcal{S}_{l}$ denote
    the set of static features of location $l$, and $\mathcal{X}_{t,l}$ be the collection
    of dynamic features for location $l$ at time $t$. The collection of dynamic features
    from location $l$ within an historical window (i.e., observing time window) with
    size $k$ up to time $t$ can be represented as $\mathcal{X}_{t-k+1:t,l}=(\mathcal{X}_{t-k+1,l},...,\mathcal{X}_{t,l})$.

    the occurrence of a future civil unrest (e.g., protest) for each location $l$
    at time $t^{*}$. Note that $t^{*}$ can be either a time point ($t+\Delta$) or
    a time window in the future ($t+\Delta:t+\Delta+\delta$). $\Delta\geq 1$ is the
    lead time that denotes the number of time steps in advance for a prediction. We
    use $\delta\geq 0$ to denote the lead time window that represents whether a civil
    unrest event will occur between time $t+\Delta$ and $t+\Delta+\delta$.

    unrest variable $\mathcal{Y}_{t^{*},l}\in\{0,1,...,M-1\}$ at the future time $t^{*}$
    for the target location $l$. If there is only one category of events to be predicted,
    $\mathcal{Y}_{t^{*},l}=1(0)$ indicates that events of interest will (not) occur
    at location $l$ at time $t^{*}$. If there are multiple categories of events to
    be predicted at the same time ($M>2$), this problem becomes a multi-label classification
    problem where the target value indicates the occurrence of multiple classes (e.g.,
    multiple subtypes of events), i.e., $\mathcal{Y}_{t^{*},l}=\{0,1\}^{M}$.

    as basic features for modeling future event patterns of interest. Recent research
    has incorporated public media data as features for civil unrest forecasting. This
    type of data is known as Open Source Indicators (OSI). OSI includes traditional
    media data such as digital newspapers, blogs, and social media data such as posts
    from Twitter and Facebook. These data provide a wealth of background information
    that helps one understand the social context and public opinion of civil unrest
    events. Economic indicators and other meta-data sources have also been explored
    in this line of research. Studies show that exogenous political and economic variables
    can serve as the necessary underlying drivers of social unrest besides social
    media (Wolfsfeld et al., [2013](#bib.bib142); Meng and Srihari, [[n.d.]](#bib.bib87)).

    utilizes variants of RNN (e.g., LSTM and GRU) to model time series data, especially
    when the input sequence is not short. [Smith et al.](#bib.bib118) (Smith et al.,

    cell states that can remove or add information to the cell. Thanks to this structure,
    LSTM is more accurate on datasets with very long sequences. GRU is another recurrent
    neural network that uses fewer training parameters and therefore uses less memory
    leading to faster training than LSTM.  [Parrish et al.](#bib.bib96) (Parrish et al.,

    individuals physically and mentally, and communities that experience higher crime
    rates are also adversely affected. Studying crime trends and patterns has been
    a top priority for law enforcement agencies, which use historical data to develop
    effective predictive policies to make a peaceful community (Perry, [2013](#bib.bib97)).
    A wealth of research has emerged on the prediction of crime incidences. The predictive
    capability can assist in crime prevention by facilitating the effective implementation
    of police patrols. In this section, we first formally introduce the problem of
    crime prediction, followed by a review of crime data resources. We then summarize

    cell or a community. We use a three-order tensor $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{X}}\in\mathbb{R}^{I\times
    J\times T}$ to denote the crime data, where $x_{ijt}$ is the number of $j$-th
    category crime incidents committed at the $i$-th region during the $t$-th time
    slot. Given a time window of length $k$, a historical crime tensor $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{X}}_{t-k+1:t}=(\mathbf{X}_{t-k+1},...,\mathbf{X}_{t})$
    is defined to represent the number of occurrences of different categories of crimes
    over a historical window starting from the $(t-k+1)$-th to $t$-th time slot. $\mathbf{X}_{t}$

    features can be specified for each region $i$, each time slot $j$, or both. Simply
    put, we denote the external features of the whole area as $\mathcal{E}$. The external
    feature can be an empty set when the prediction is purely based on crime occurrence

    such as road network can be obtained from such data source (Belesiotis et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib15); Zhang et al., [2019](#bib.bib157); Ye et al., [2021](#bib.bib148)).
    Some researchers have explored visual data in crime prediction (Zhang et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib157)), such as Google Street View data, which provide more than
    10 million miles of street view imagery across 83 countries. Social media data
    have also been investigated in this line of study. For instance, Twitter posts
    with rich and event-based context were leveraged for predicting criminal incidents (Wang
    et al., [2012](#bib.bib135); Zhang et al., [2019](#bib.bib157)) and next-location
    of crime activities (Wang and Gerber, [2015](#bib.bib132)).

    tools for spatial data. GIS is useful for mapping and retrospectively finding
    links between criminal structures and various spatial and social conditions (Groff
    and La Vigne, [2002](#bib.bib47); Chainey and Ratcliffe, [2013](#bib.bib25); Kedia,
    [2016](#bib.bib68); Jakobi and Pődör, [2020](#bib.bib60)), but itself does not
    provide much predictive power. With the increasing availability of fine-grained
    urban data, such as public service data, meteorological data, POI data, and human
    mobility data, data-driven crime prediction problems have received extensive attention
    from researchers for decades. Many data-driven approaches have emerged that enable

    models. [Gorr et al.](#bib.bib46) (Gorr et al., [2003](#bib.bib46)) focused on
    predicting crime 30 days ahead for small areas, like police precincts. In a case
    study of Pittsburgh, they demonstrated that simple univariate time series models
    including Random Walk, Brown’s Simple Exponential Smoothing (Brown, [2004](#bib.bib19)),
    and Holt’s Two-Parameter Linear Exponential Smoothing (Brown, [2004](#bib.bib19))
    are more accurate than naive methods commonly used by many police departments
    (i.e., Lag 12). Several statistical time series models have been investigated
    in this area, such as binomial regression (Wang et al., [2016b](#bib.bib130),
    [2017](#bib.bib131)) and autoregressive models. Autoregressive Integrated Moving
    Average (ARIMA) was applied in one-week-ahead (Chen et al., [2008](#bib.bib30))
    and two-year-ahead (Cesario et al., [2016](#bib.bib24)) crime occurrence prediction.
    Some researchers studied autoregressive models in more complex scenarios by incorporating
    spatial analysis (Shoesmith, [2013](#bib.bib117); Catlett et al., [2018](#bib.bib22),
    [2019](#bib.bib23)) and network analytic techniques (Dash et al., [2018](#bib.bib34))
    as well as developing hybrid models (Alwee et al., [2013](#bib.bib5)). In addition
    to time series models, statistical Bayesian models were developed to forecast
    next crime locations (Liao et al., [2010](#bib.bib81)) and to model spatial (Balocchi
    and Jensen, [2019](#bib.bib13)) or spatio-temporal (Hu et al., [2018](#bib.bib54))

    feature representation and abstraction, where each feature layer operates independently
    using a set of features. They are then concatenated for joint feature representation

    data with convolution kernels/filters. CNN has been extensively studied in crime
    prediction and has shown advantages in improving prediction accuracy by learning
    spatial features in crime data. The convolutional and pooling layers are two main
    building blocks of CNNs. Fig. [2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.4.1\. Feedforward Neural
    Network Based Approaches ‣ 3.4\. Deep Learning Models ‣ 3\. Crime Prediction ‣
    A Survey on Societal Event Forecasting with Deep Learning") shows a simple example
    of convolution. In this example, the input is a two-dimensional tensor of size
    $3\times 3$, and the kernel/convolution window is a two-dimensional tensor of
    size $2\times 2$. The convolution window slides over the input tensor and performs
    element-wise multiplication with corresponding elements. The resulting tensor
    is summed up yielding a single scalar value. Convolution operation usually involves
    several other techniques such as padding, stride, and dilation, which control
    the size of the output. Pooling is a downsampling method that reduces the spatial
    size of the representation as well as the number of parameters and computation
    in the network. Fig. [2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.4.1\. Feedforward Neural Network

    to predict the occurrence of felonies on the next day. They employed crime event
    counts and 311 data and converted them into two 2D image-like arrays as input
    features. The STCN consists of convolutional layers, an inception block, a fractal
    block (Larsson et al., [2016](#bib.bib77)) (i.e., an alternative of the residual
    block that can achieve excellent performance as standard residual networks), pooling
    layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers capture low-level spatio-temporal
    dependencies of criminal events, and the inception and fractal blocks intend to
    abstract high-level spatio-temporal features. [Wang et al.](#bib.bib129) (Wang
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib129)) applied a popular deep CNN architecture, Spatio-Temporal
    Residual Networks (ST-ResNet) (Zhang et al., [2017](#bib.bib155)), to predict
    crime distributions over the Los Angeles area on an hourly timescale. The ST-ResNet
    captures crime dynamics through convolutional layers and employs residual neural
    networks to model the temporal features of crimes. Due to the low regularity of
    crime data in both space and time, the authors preprocessed the crime data to
    select appropriate spatio-temporal scales for prediction and proposed different
    data regularization methods for spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore,
    to address the problem of the sparsity of crime events in space and time,  [Ye
    et al.](#bib.bib148) (Ye et al., [2021](#bib.bib148)) proposed a deep inception-residual
    network (DIRNet) to conduct theft-related crime prediction based on crime and
    311 data. This framework consists of convolutional layers and inception layers
    to extract spatiotemporal dependencies from crime and 311 data, respectively.
    The learned features are then combined and fed to stacked residual layers to capture
    high-level feature interactions for final prediction.

    Approaches ‣ 3.4\. Deep Learning Models ‣ 3\. Crime Prediction ‣ A Survey on Societal
    Event Forecasting with Deep Learning"). The framework contains two components.
    The first part is spatial-temporal weighted graph (STWG) inference. It results
    in a graph representation for the spatio-temporal evolution of the data. Each
    graph node is associated with a time series of crime intensity in a region, and
    the graph topology is inferred from the self-exciting point process model. The
    graph representation captures versatile spatial partitioning that enables forecasting
    at different spatial scales. The second component is a deep learning model that
    approximates the temporal evolution of the data. They introduced a graph-structured
    RNN (GSRNN) on the inferred graph based on the structural-RNN (SRNN) (Jain et al.,
    [2016](#bib.bib59)) architecture. The GSRNN arranges RNNs in a feedforward manner.
    It first assigns a cascaded LSTM to fit the time series on each node in the graph.
    Simultaneously, it associates each edge in the graph with a cascaded LSTM that
    receives the output from neighboring nodes along with the weights learned from
    the Hawkes process. The specially designed deep neural network takes advantage
    of the RNN’s ability to learn time series patterns, capturing real-time interactions
    of each node to its connected neighbors.

    quality, which makes them subject to a number of data challenges. The dynamic
    nature of data is one of the main challenges. For text data, language, vocabulary,
    and mainstream slang are constantly evolving. In geographic data, location names
    and area boundaries may change due to major political events. Proposing advanced
    deep learning methods that can overcome the problem of data dynamics is of great
    significance for practical applications. The sufficiency of data is another challenge.
    As seen in existing work, researchers have investigated various external data
    sources in addition to historical event occurrences to improve the accuracy of
    predictions. Collecting external data from multiple sources and distinguishing
    correlated data from noisy data is expensive in terms of time, material, and computational
    costs. Moreover, the spatial scarcity of societal events will also hinder event
    prediction studies in underrepresented areas. A further fundamental issue in forecasting
    problems is data reliability. Missing or incorrect data often occurs during manual
    or automated data collection. For example, automated event collection systems
    may lose events due to unexpected network failures. Social media posts provide
    valuable resources for tracking user behavior and social activities. However,
    such data include typos, chit-chat, and misinformation that can mislead predictive
    models. Hence, over-reliance on data can make prediction models vulnerable to

    and interpretability. Relying solely on model predictions to analyze societal
    events and make decisions can lead to economic loss or other unwanted consequences
    due to misjudgments. One can mitigate such problems by providing reasonable explanations
    for model predictions so that practitioners can understand the behavior of the
    models and thus assess the reliability of the output produced by these models.
