    which, on the one hand, created new possibilities for human activities and technological
    improvement, while, on the other hand, has paved the way to the rapid spreading
    of new pathogens. Many scientific reports are linking environment-invasive human
    activity to the emergence of novel zoonotic viruses Bengis et al. ([2004](#bib.bib4)).
    Among these, airborne diseases are the most worrying, due to their capability
    of spreading at a fast pace (e.g, SARS, MERS, H1N1). Most notably, the recent
    outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 Velavan and Meyer ([2020](#bib.bib24)), which started in
    Wuhan, China, in 2020 (possibly even 2019), has been a great challenge for our

    dynamics of the virus on a short and long-term range is of crucial relevance to
    counteract the surging of an epidemic. The decision process regarding policies
    apt at containing the spreading of the virus is dependent on accurate predictive
    systems since they allow the evaluation of different scenarios and intervention
    plans. To this end, many epidemiological models have been developed in the past
    to approximate the dynamics of a disease Duan et al. ([2015](#bib.bib7)). However,

    aspects of the epidemic might help to improve the accuracy of the predictive model.
    For instance, knowledge on the trend of temperature in specific regions might
    increase the chances of capturing a seasonal behavior of the virus, if present,
    whereas information regarding population density allows to identify scenarios
    with high contact rates among individuals, hence increasing the likelihood of
    contagion. Moreover, for most epidemics, countries cannot be considered isolated
    due to the highly infectious nature of some viruses and the frequent population
    flows between borders. Consequently, the information regarding neighboring countries
    could consistently improve the understanding of the epidemic.

    the dynamics of epidemics (and more in general sequential data), thanks to their
    structure and capability of developing a long-term memory. In the RNNs family,
    we include Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Gated Recursive Unit (GRU),
    which are particularly suited for temporal series. The standard application of
    RNNs involves the construction of an appropriate dataset by arranging each feature
    according to the number of look-back days, namely, how many days in the past are
    taken as input when making a prediction. This allows incorporating in the forecasting
    process information regarding the general trend of the epidemiological curve.

    where authors have used LSTM and GRU to model the COVID-19 pandemic data (i.e.,
    number of infected, deceased, and recovered cases) of different countries, with
    results that show how these methods outperform more classical ML approaches in
    terms of prediction accuracy on historical data, such as Support Vector Regression
    (SVR), Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving
    Average (ARIMA). In the same study, the authors improved the model using Bidirectional
    LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to enhance the capability of developing a long-term memory in the
    model. While classical RNNs-based approaches process sequential data in a specific
    order, i.e., from past to future, Bi-LSTM allows the information to flow in both
    directions of the time series (i.e., past-future, future-past), with an increase

    one, resulting in more complex and deeper models. This method, called Stacked-LSTM,

    proposed an LSTM-based method incorporating geographical proximity information
    and climate variables (e.g., humidity, temperature, precipitation) to predict
    the number of flu cases in the population. The approach consists of two steps:
    in the first stage, the LSTM neural network is trained on the flu time series,
    while in the second stage, the impact of climatic variables and spatio-temporal
    adjustment is added to the flu counts estimated by the LSTM model. The contextual
    features are integrated into the learning process via a linear combination of

    trends. As CNNs have been proved useful at dealing with spatial proximity (by
    extracting features embedding the spatial locality), they can be adopted for dealing
    with temporal locality as well, as in the case of ordered sequential data.

    and require the model to predict the next data points in the series; however,
    CNNs are known to be prone to overfitting historical data. Nevertheless, this
    can be sufficient in presence of poor contextual data to outperform LSTM or simpler
    algorithms such as decision trees (DT) Kunjir et al. ([2020](#bib.bib14)). Predictions
    can be improved by feeding the models with multiple correlated time series. For
    example, in Huang et al. ([2020a](#bib.bib10)) authors use the data relative to
    confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases to predict the daily count of infected.
    The CNN is compared with LSTM, GRU, and MLP models on 7 different Chinese cities

    in the field of predictive epidemiology, is Temporal CNN (TCN), which showed to
    have comparable, if not better, performance w.r.t. RNNs. The approach was first
    presented in Lea et al. ([2016](#bib.bib15)) and it is based on the deployment
    of causal convolution for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks. In this method,
    the kernel is applied only over data relative to the present time step or previous
    input points in the sequence, avoiding information leakage from future to past.
    The network architecture is based on 1-D fully convolutional layers with the same
    length as the input data. This methodology is gaining increasing attention from
    the DL community and we regard it as a valuable approach going forward in the

    epidemic. The researchers considered the data of the USA and Japan, i.e., the
    weekly reported patients count over a single state or prefecture. In this work,
    the authors used CNNs to fuse information from different data sources (e.g., different
    regions) and GRUs to capture the long-term correlation in the time series, with
    a residual structure. The residual structure is adopted to introduce highly relevant
    long-jumps in the information flow (e.g., capture annual epidemiology patterns).
    We can observe that the CNNs were used to learn correlations among signals, while
    GRUs were targeting correlation within every single signal. However, the truly
    innovative solution provided in this work is the use of an adjacent nearest neighbor
    matrix as a filter of the convolutional kernel of each country. This sort of adjacent
    convolution gets parameters focused on more local information in opposition to
    the classical grid convolution, implying that a single filter could be able to
    represent more complex patterns, which are usually captured by multiple filters
    when using the classical grid convolution.

    the most promising frameworks for virus spreading forecasting. Many of the traditional
    epidemiological models have deployed complex networks to describe the dynamic
    of epidemics. Consequently, GNNs are capable of extending the principle at the
    foundation to such data structure. For this reason, we reckon that a very promising
    direction consists in exploring GNNs which explicitly model the graph-based structure
    encoding the topological relations at the heart of epidemics spreading (e.g.,

    The main idea is to model the spreading starting from a network of individuals
    (i.e., the nodes) that can interact in specific ways (i.e., the edges). Then approximate
    the function mapping the vertex into a positive real number representing the count
    of infected nodes through node regression, assuming to have some initial contagions
    in the population. This method can be either based on pure GNNs or on propositional
    learners, where the first uses the adjacent matrix during the training of the

    models (AR). This class of models offers a variety of tailored solutions capturing
    different aspects of sequential data, such as Vector Auto-Regressive models (VAR),
    Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA).
    The key idea behind AR is to forecast the future using past information, more
    specifically a linear combination of the predictors. While these methodologies
    have proved to be effective in the case of epidemiological data, often the nature
    of the underlying AR technique is not suited to capture nonlinearities in the
    features. Many studies are tackling directly this issue, mainly combining both
    AR and DL to mitigate their respective deficiencies in an ensemble fashion. In
    Chakraborty et al. ([2019](#bib.bib5)) and Wei et al. ([2016](#bib.bib29)) the
    focus is precisely on approximating both linear and non-linear aspects of the
    data; this is achieved by combining an ARIMA model and a Neural Autoregressive
    Network (NNAR) on the residuals. Wang et al. ([2020b](#bib.bib28)) propose a slightly
    improved version of this approach, relying on the SARIMA model, which explicitly
    encapsulates the seasonal component The fusion of AR and DL shows a steady improvement
    in the accuracy of the prediction w.r.t. vanilla approaches. However, these models
    consider only the temporal component of the data, while the usage of contextual
    information and spatial data could be decisive to obtain high-quality forecasts.
    A step in this direction is proposed in Wang et al. ([2019](#bib.bib26)), where
    the aforementioned method based on SARIMA, is improved by integrating into the
    training process exogenous inputs, namely a set of variables or a series that
    are not directly related to learning target, but that influence it.

    of domain-specific knowledge Muralidhar et al. ([2018](#bib.bib17)). The general
    idea is to design the learning process to incorporate data and techniques that
    are specifically referred to some particular aspect of the domain in consideration.
    In the case of predictive epidemiology, this tendency has materialized in hybrid
    approaches integrating compartmental models and deep learning. Historically, many
    forecasting methods for virus-spreading have been proposed Duan et al. ([2015](#bib.bib7)).
    Among the most notable we find compartmental models, i.e. mathematical models
    where the population is divided into categories representing different conditions
    w.r.t. the epidemic, and that describe the progression of the virus through differential
    equations (e.g. SIR: Susceptible-Infected-Recovered).'

- en: In Farooq and Bazaz ([2020](#bib.bib8)) this idea is applied to predict the
    evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. More specifically, the proposed framework
    is based on a SIRVD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated-Deceased) dynamic
    system which approximates the epidemiological curve; the parameters describing
    the transition into the different compartments are learned through an incremental
    learning approach. The idea is that a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) can be
    used to iteratively approximate the incoming data, which is updated based on the
    progression of the pandemic; this allows to improve the model without training
    the ANN on the whole dataset every time is updated. In similar fashion Jo et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib13)) proposed a forward-inverse neural network for SIR models.
    This solution can be considered as a sort of end-to-end approach where the parameters
    and the compartment (or category, such as the infected individuals in the population)
    at each time step are estimated with a time-dependent FFNN based on the historical
    data of COVID-19 in South Korea. This model shows the gain in terms of explainability
    deriving from the use of a hybrid framework.

    ([2020a](#bib.bib27)). In this case, the proposed methodology attempts to solve
    problems related to scarce data with a data augmentation framework for forecasting
    the incidence of Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI) in the USA. The model, which is
    called Theory Guided Deep Learning Based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information,
    or TDEFSI, integrates the strengths of deep neural networks and high-resolution
    simulations of epidemic processes over complex networks. The data augmentation
    is performed by generating synthetic data using computer-based simulations of
    causal processes that capture epidemic dynamics: for instance, given a US state
    and an existing disease model (e.g., Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered),
    a marginal distribution is estimated for each parameter in the model. Then, a
    synthetic training dataset is generated for the target US state by sampling from
    the learned marginal distributions. The core model is composed of a two-branch
    LSTM-based deep neural network that captures the temporal dynamics of both within-season
    observations and between-seasons observations. The main advantage of this method
    is the capability to synthesize a large volume of time series from simulations
    based on epidemiology theory, reducing the risk of overfitting while training
    the model. At the same time, this method introduces the challenge of minimizing
    the gap between synthetic and real data, which is a non-trivial problem in itself.'

- en: In the previous sections, we have outlined two trends in the creation of epidemiological
    DL-based predictive models. We observed a group of methods that adopt pure DL
    methods, using either a conservative (i.e., vanilla) application of ANNs or more
    sophisticated implementations combining different models to target varying aspects
    in the data. The other trend is focused on hybrid DL models. These methods focus
    on finding ways to combine traditional techniques of predictive epidemiology,
    namely autoregression and compartmental dynamic systems, with ANNs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both approaches seem to be effective to solve the task at hand (i.e. epidemic
    spreading forecasting), however, we would like to point out some of the main advantages
    and disadvantages of these methodological strategies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flexibility and the abstraction provided by deep ANNs generate accurate
    models, which proved themselves capable of capturing at least the general trend
    of the epidemic. Moreover, the learning process requires minimal assumptions on
    the problem at hand and almost no human intervention during the training process.
    This can be extremely helpful in case of new and unexplored situations, such as
    COVID-19, where we want to analyze the phenomenon without biases. Pure Deep Learning
    approaches can also adapt naturally to evolving conditions, such as changes in
    the mobility patterns and daily routines emerging as a reaction to the pandemic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We have also observed how these models can be improved consistently in two
    ways: first, by adding contextual information such as seasonal or urban-environment
    features, and second, developing more sophisticated approaches, which, for instance,
    combine different types of networks. This is especially useful when dealing with
    spatial and temporal data, as each sub-network can deal with a particular aspect
    of the data, in a way decomposing the overall problem.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, beyond the more classical applications of RNNs and CNNs, we identified
    new possible approaches to build epidemiological predictive systems. In particular,
    we have briefly discussed the deployment of TCNs and GNNs and they could lead
    to an improvement of the forecasting accuracy. Unfortunately, these areas have
    been relatively understudied so far, and we reckon that there lies a great potential
    ripe to be exploited; we hope that future research will explore these directions.
    Above all, we believe GNNs could allow us to formulate the learning task in a
    way that is suited to represent epidemiological scenarios, and represent spatio-temporal
    data, as well as mimicking the processes underlying the spreading of a virus.

- en: Pure DL methodologies do not provide the possibility of exploiting the domain
    knowledge available in the field of predictive epidemiology. Moreover, these models
    are lacking in terms of interpretability of the results, which might be a crucial
    aspect, especially if the predictions are the basis for a decision process; broadly
    speaking, the possibility to interpret and explain the predictions is a mandatory
    requirement wherever human health is concerned Ahmad et al. ([2018](#bib.bib2)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To this end, hybrid models tend to be more effective at incorporating well-established
    practices and provide interpretable results. In particular, the integration of
    compartmental models and DL seems to be one of the most promising research directions
    to explore. These models allow to obtain explainable predictions, based on simple
    and known principles of epidemiology. However they might also inherit some of
    the assumptions and rigidity of the classical approaches (e.g., a limited amount
    of compartments to describe the epidemic), therefore they might require some further
    elaboration to be adapted to a specific disease. Fortunately, compartmental models
    are highly customizable Giordano et al. ([2020](#bib.bib9)), therefore easy to
    mold on the virus under scrutiny.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, the integration of domain-specific methods into the learning process
    might help generalize the model beyond the training data, proving to be quite
    useful in presence of scarce information on the epidemic. For this reason, we
    believe that hybrid models could be more suited to support specific containment
    policies and provide the means to evaluate different scenarios relative to multiple
    intervention plans.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An important area of open research, where little progress has been currently
    made , involves how to best take into account the effect of containment measures
    on the spread of an epidemic. This ability is a key requirement to support decision-makers
    in the identification of the best approach for managing the trade-off between
    health, societal, and economic costs. Taking into account these factors in primarily
    data-driven methods can be very challenging, since data about containment measures
    is generally scarce (especially at the beginning of an epidemic), and data about
    historical epidemics may not be entirely reliable when a new pathogen appears.

- en: The recent outbreak of coronavirus has proved our unpreparedness relatively
    to unexpected scenarios. In this context, the availability of accurate predictive
    models capable of forecasting the virus spreading in space and time is crucial
    to make informed and scientifically proved decisions to stem the virus. The use
    of DL to solve this problem has widely increased, showing interesting improvements
    w.r.t. more classical approaches. Given the current situation, this class of methods
    will be increasingly applied to tackle this problem in the coming years. For this
    reason, we have attempted to outline the main trends in this field, hoping to
    provide a starting point for readers approaching this challenge.
