- en: For its robust predictive power (compared to pure physics-based models) and
    sample-efficient training (compared to pure deep learning models), physics-informed
    deep learning (PIDL), a paradigm hybridizing physics-based models and deep neural
    networks (DNN), has been booming in science and engineering fields. One key challenge
    of applying PIDL to various domains and problems lies in the design of a computational
    graph that integrates physics and DNNs. In other words, how physics are encoded
    into DNNs and how the physics and data components are represented. In this paper,
    we provide a variety of architecture designs of PIDL computational graphs and
    how these structures are customized to traffic state estimation (TSE), a central
    problem in transportation engineering. When observation data, problem type, and
    goal vary, we demonstrate potential architectures of PIDL computational graphs
    and compare these variants using the same real-world dataset.

    pattern learning, how to inject physics into neural networks (NN) remains under-explored
    and varies case by case and across domains. We will summarize and establish a
    systematic design pipeline for hybrid computational graphs that facilitates the
    integration of physics and NNs. The insights into the modular design of the hybrid
    PIDL paradigm as well as the established visualization tool will not only be useful
    to guide transportation researchers to pursue PIDL, but can also facilitate researchers
    at large to better understand and decompose a PIDL problem when applied to their
    own application domains. It will hopefully open up the conversation across domains
    about establishing a unified PIDL paradigm.

    data science” [[2](#bib.bib2)], “model-informed machine learning” [[3](#bib.bib3)],
    or “physics-informed machine learning” [[4](#bib.bib4)], has gained increasing
    traction in various scientific and engineering fields. Its underlying rationale
    is to leverage the pros of both physics-based and data-driven approaches while
    compensating the cons of each. Physics-based approach refers to scientific hypotheses
    of what underlying physics govern observations, like the first principle. Normally,
    scientists or engineers first come up with a prior assumption of how a quantity
    of interest is computed from other physics quantities. Then laboratory or field
    experiments are designed to collect data that are used to calibrate the involved
    parameters. In contrast, data-driven approach does not bear any prior knowledge
    of how things work and how different quantities are correlated. Instead, they
    rely on machine learning (ML) techniques such as deep learning (DL) to learn and
    infer patterns from data. The former is data-efficient and interpretable but may
    not be generalizable to unobserved data, while the latter is generalizable at
    cost of relying on huge amounts of training samples and may be incapable of offering
    deductive insights. Thus, the PIDL paradigm opens up a promising research direction
    that leverages the strengths of both physics-based and data-driven approaches.
    Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Physics-Informed Deep Learning For
    Traffic State Estimation: A Survey and the Outlook") summarizes the amounts of
    data (in x-axis) and scientific theory (in y-axis) used for each paradigm. Model
    based approaches heavily rely on the scientific theory discovered from the domain
    knowledge and little data for system discovery, while machine learning approaches
    mostly rely on data for mechanism discovery, In contrast, PIDL employs a small
    amount of data (i.e., “small data” [[4](#bib.bib4)]) for pattern discovery while
    leveraging a certain amount of scientific knowledge to impose physically consistent
    constraints. The “sweetspot” of PIDL lies in the small data and partial knowledge
    regime. In other words, PIDL achieves the best performance in accuracy and robustness
    with small data and partial domain knowledge. In this paper, we will validate
    the advantage of PIDL using transportation applications, and present a series
    of experiments using the same real-world dataset against conventional physics-based
    models.'

    on the PIDL framework that is represented by a *hybrid computational graph* (HCG)
    consisting of two graphs: a physics-informed computational graph (PICG) and a
    physics-uninformed neural networks (PUNN). Despite numerous benefits of PIDL,
    there are still many open questions that need to be answered, including the construction
    of the HCG, the choice of the physics and the architecture of the PICG, the architecture
    of the PUNN, the loss function, and the training algorithms. Among them, how to
    encode physics into (deep) neural networks (DNN) remains under-explored and varies
    case by case and across domains. In this paper, we will primarily establish a
    systematic design pipeline for hybrid computational graphs that would facilitate
    the integration of physics and DL. To this end, we will review the state-of-the-art
    of the PIDL architecture in traffic state estimation (TSE) problem. This survey
    paper can be used as a guideline for researchers at large when they consider using
    PIDL for problems at hand.'

    systems [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5)]. However, its feasibility for social
    systems, in particular, human decision making processes, such as driving behaviors,
    remains largely unexploited. Human’s decision-making involves complex cognitive
    processes compounded by perception errors, noisy observations, and output randomness.
    Moreover, human driving behaviors exhibit highly unstable and nonlinear patterns,
    leading to stop-and-go traffic waves and traffic congestion [[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7),
    [8](#bib.bib8)]. Accordingly, neither model-driven nor data-driven approach alone
    suffices to predict such behaviors with high accuracy and robustness. Thereby,
    we strongly believe that a hybrid method, which leverages the advantage of both
    model-driven and data-driven approaches, are promising [[9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10)].

    and for PIDL [[4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5)], respectively. To distinguish from
    other survey papers in TSE, here we primarily focus on data-driven approaches,
    PIDL in particular. Since PIDL for TSE is less studied than physics-based models
    and the existing literature is focused on single roads, we will primarily examine
    TSE along links and leave that on a road network, which includes both link and
    node models, for future research. To distinguish from other PIDL surveys, we primarily
    focus on the modular design of the hybrid PIDL paradigm and show how to customize
    various designs for accurate and robust identification of traffic dynamic patterns.
    Here the *modular design* refers to the architecture design of each component
    in the graph and how these components are wired, in other words, how physics laws
    are injected into DNNs. The generic architecture of a PIDL consists of two computational
    graphs: one DNN (i.e., the data-driven component) for predicting the unknown solution,
    while the other (i.e., the physics-driven component), in which physics are represented,
    for evaluating whether the prediction aligns with the given physics. The physics
    encoded computational graph can be treated as a regularization term of the other
    deep neural network to prevent overfitting, i.e., high-variance. In summary, the
    hybrid of both components overcomes high-bias and high-variance induced by each
    individual one, rendering it possible to leverage the advantage of both the physics-based
    and data-driven methods in terms of model accuracy and data efficiency.'

    graphs: (1) a PUNN, denoted as $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x},t)$, to approximate mapping
    $\mathbf{s}^{(i)}$, and (2) a PICG, denoted as $f_{\lambda}(\mathbf{x},t)$, for
    computing traffic states of $\mathbf{s}^{(j)}$ from collocation points. In summary,
    a general PIDL model, denoted as $f_{\theta,\lambda}(\mathbf{x},t)$, is to train
    an optimal parameter set $\theta^{*}$ for PUNN and an optimal parameter set $\lambda^{*}$
    for the physics. The PUNN parameterized by the solution $\theta^{*}$ can then
    be used to predict a traffic state $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{new}$ on a new set of observed
    ST points ${\cal O}_{new}\subseteq{\cal D}$, and $\lambda^{*}$ is the most likely
    model parameters that describe the intrinsic physics of observed data.'

    the PUNN and the PICG, the loss function to train the PUNN, and the training paradigm
    can be defined visually. A computational graph, establishing mathematical consistency
    across scales, is a labeled directed graph whose nodes are (un)observable physical
    quantities representing input information, intermediate quantities, and target
    objectives. The directed edges connecting physical quantities represent the dependency
    of a target variable on source variables, carrying a mathematical or ML mapping
    from a source to a target quantity. A path from a source to the observable output
    quantities represents one configuration of a model. A model configuration is to
    establish a path within the HCG [[57](#bib.bib57)].

- en: Sequential training is the default paradigm in most PIDL-related studies, with
    a focus on how to make the training robust and stable, when large-scale NNs and
    complicated physics-informed loss functions are involved. A growing amount of
    works aim to develop more robust NN architectures and training algorithms for
    PIDL. For example, one can use adaptive activation function by introducing a scalable
    hyper-parameter in the activation function at some layers of the PUNN to improve
    the convergence rate and solution accuracy [[72](#bib.bib72)]. The adaptive activation
    function has also been used in DeLISA (deep learning based iteration scheme approximation),
    which adopts the implicit multistep method and Runge-Kutta method for time iteration
    scheme to construct the learning loss when training the PUNN [[73](#bib.bib73)].
    To perform an efficient and stable convergence in the training phase, [[74](#bib.bib74)]
    investigates the training dynamics using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and
    proposes a NTK-guided gradient descent algorithm to adaptively adjust the hyperparameters
    for each loss component. New algorithms and computational frameworks for improving
    general PIDL training are currently a popular research area, and we refer readers
    to [[4](#bib.bib4)] by Karniadakis et al. for a detailed survey on this topic.

    training for all the parameters with real-world noisy data leads to unsatisfactory
    results [[71](#bib.bib71)]. For this issue, the alternating direction method of
    multipliers (ADMM) method [[76](#bib.bib76)] is an option to improve training
    stability, i.e., to train one subset of physical parameters at a time with the
    rest fixed. The advanced ADMM variant, deep learning ADMM (dlADMM), may further

    uncertainty propagates within dynamical systems that could result in cascading
    errors, unreliable predictions, and worst of all, non-optimal operation and management
    strategies. It is thus crucial to characterize uncertainties in traffic state
    estimators and consequently, in traffic management that relies on TSE predictors.

    traffic state inference and uncertainty quantification. We present the concept
    of HCG that integrates both a PUNN and a PICG. In the TSE problem in particular,
    we present various architecture design. For the traffic state inference problem,
    the PUNN and PICG can be linked in sequence or in parallel, depending on whether
    traffic velocity is computed from traffic density using FDs, or whether both velocity
    and density are computed from PUNN(s) simultaneously. For the UQ problem, GAN
    and non-GAN based adversarial generative models are presented to characterize
    the impact of measurement uncertainty on traffic states. The architecture variants,
    including PI-GAN, PID-GAN, Mean-GAN, PI-GAN-FDL, PI-Flow, and TrafficFlowGAN are
    introduced. This is the first study that compare PIDL model variants using the
    same real-world dataset, which provides a benchmark platform for model comparison.
    By comparing various PIDL models, we demonstrate that this paradigm is advantageous
    over pure physics or data-driven approaches in the “small data” regime, and also
    allows a smooth transition from pure physics-driven to data-driven models via
    tuning the hyperparameters in the loss. Tab. [5](#S5.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 5.1 Conclusions

    (i.e., a mapping from multiscale measurements to traffic states on different scales)
    that collectively infers traffic states with various measurements. Analytical
    multiscale models have been thoroughly studied in fields like biological [[13](#bib.bib13)]
    and materials science [[106](#bib.bib106)], but remain under-exploited in transportation
    modeling. The drivers of developing a multiscale traffic model are two-fold: (1)
    Sensor data are at different scales. The collected traffic data include high-resolution
    individual trajectories and low-resolution aggregate information, both at various
    spatiotemporal granularity. Traffic measurements on different scales essentially
    measure the same system and phenomenon. Accordingly, a multiscale model capable
    of integrating measurements of various scales could characterize traffic dynamics
    more accurately with a smaller dataset. (2) Traffic optimization and management
    strategies need to rely on diverse models and data of different scales. Individual
    traces are normally modeled using ODEs while aggregate traffic patterns are modeled
    with PDEs. An integrated ODE-PDE physics model can potentially accommodate these
    measurements at both micro- and macro-scale [[107](#bib.bib107)]. Multiscale traffic
    models could also help reduce model complexity and speed up simulation for real-time
    applications.'

    the curse of dimensionality (i.e., high-dimensional input-output pairs). It is

    [111](#bib.bib111)]. Traffic engineers have spent decades discovering various
    physical laws to describe human behavior models, from car-following, lane-change,
    to other driving scenarios and tasks. Is it possible to develop a systematic method
    to select mathematical models? For example, selection of a model can be reformulated
    as finding an optimal path over the PICG from inputs to outputs [[112](#bib.bib112)].
    Accordingly, model selection is converted to an optimization problem. Machine
    learning methods, such as neural architecture search [[113](#bib.bib113)] and
    automatic modularization of network architecture [[114](#bib.bib114)], could enable
    the automatic architecture design of PICG and PUNN.

    physics, thus, how to learn patterns around shockwave, which corresponds to the
    discontinuity of which gradients do not exist, remains an active research area
    in PIDL. There is a small amount of literature that discussed such a limitation
    using PIDL for nonlinear PDEs with solutions containing shocks and waves. One
    solution is to add viscosity terms [[115](#bib.bib115), [68](#bib.bib68), [71](#bib.bib71)]

    the physics constraints as part of the loss function, the fulfillment of physics
    constraints cannot be guaranteed, leading to poor prediction in shocks and waves.
    Thus, “hard” methods that enforce physics can be a radical remedy. One option
    is to convert the TSE problem using varational formulation [[116](#bib.bib116)],
    and define an energy-based loss function [[117](#bib.bib117)] that naturally adopts
    the objective function in the variational formulation.

    collected from city $A$, can we directly generalize the prediction out of the
    NN using data from city $B$? Traffic datasets from two cities could differ drastically
    in the underlying traffic dynamics (arising from heterogeneity in driver behavior
    such as that in San Francisco and Mumbai), traffic environments, road conditions,
    initial and boundary conditions, and traffic demands. To address this challenge,
    we have to modify the input of the PUNN without using $(x,t)$ but other attributes
    that vary across datasets, including but not limited to road type, geometry, lane
    width, lane number, speed limit, travel demands, traffic composition and so on.

    including but not limited to individual trajectories, camera images, radar heatmap,
    and Lidar cloud points? The existing practice is to preprocess these multimodal,
    multi-fidelity measurements using computer vision and extract aggregate traffic
    information in terms of traffic velocity and/or density within discretized spatial
    cells and time intervals. Rather than converting these data formats to conventional
    ones, we should think outside the box and potentially, redefine the entire TSE
    framework. It thus demands a shift in paradigm from what constitutes traffic states
    to one taking individual trajectories and images as inputs. In other words, is
    it sufficient to simply use aggregate traffic velocity, density, and flux to describe
    traffic states? The aggregate traffic measures were introduced decades ago when
    inductive loop detectors were deployed to measure cumulative traffic counts. Traffic
    flow has long been regarded analogous to fluids, and accordingly, hydrodynamic
    theory is applied to model traffic flow dynamics. It is natural to adapt physical
    quantities defined for fluids to traffic flow. However, traffic systems are not
    physical but social systems, in which road users constitute a complex traffic
    environment, while interacting continuously with the built environment. Contextual
    information greatly influences driving behaviors and traffic dynamics. Accordingly,
    the question is, when we describe the state of traffic and aim to optimize traffic
    management strategies, would traffic contextual information perceived by our eyes
    and brains (represented by DNNs) be helpful as an addition to those widely used
    quantitative measures, especially when this type of information becomes more widely
    available, thanks to IoT and smart city technology?

    causal inference using observational data when unobserved counfounders are present
    [[119](#bib.bib119), [120](#bib.bib120)]. However, little work has been done to
    leverage explicit causal relations from physical knowledge to improve PIDL. For
    example, counterfactual analysis of physical dynamics concerns identifying the
    casual effects of various interventions, including traffic control and the sequential
    decision-making of other agents in the environment [[121](#bib.bib121), [122](#bib.bib122),
    [123](#bib.bib123)]. Without performing extra experimentation that is risky and
    unsafe, how can we design and validate traffic management strategies using new

    when there is sparse networked sensing information, we need to straighten out
    in what representation existing physics models could be incorporated, in other
    words, how we should encode traffic states on links and those at junctions into
    what deep learning models. [[124](#bib.bib124)] predicts network flows using a
