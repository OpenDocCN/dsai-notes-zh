- en: Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, that is essential not only for
    the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science
    in observational cosmology (e.g. as a prior for photometric-redshift measurements
    and as contextual data for transient lightcurve classifications). While a rich
    literature exists on morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented
    data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming ‘Big-Data’
    surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large data
    volumes make such datasets intractable for visual inspection (even via massively-distributed
    platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to employ techniques
    like supervised machine-learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly produce
    training sets on short timescales. Unsupervised machine learning, which does not
    require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis of new
    and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering
    of graph representations, in order to group image patches with similar visual
    properties and objects constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement
    the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey,
    to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of ‘morphological
    clusters’, populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked
    using visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which we release publicly)
    exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties
    as a function of morphological type at $z<1$ (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame
    colours and the position of galaxies on the star-formation main sequence). Our
    study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate
    morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide
    surveys.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The measurement of galaxy morphology is a fundamental topic in observational
    cosmology. Morphology is a strong function of the dynamical state of a galaxy,
    encodes the physical processes that dominate its evolutionary history (e.g. Martin
    et al., [2018a](#bib.bib72)) and is strongly aligned with physical properties
    like stellar mass (e.g. Bundy et al., [2005](#bib.bib13)), star-formation rate
    (e.g. Bluck et al., [2014](#bib.bib11); Smethurst et al., [2015](#bib.bib101)),
    colour (e.g. Strateva et al., [2001](#bib.bib105); Skibba et al., [2009](#bib.bib100))
    and local environment (e.g. Dressler, [1980](#bib.bib28); Dressler et al., [1997](#bib.bib29);
    Postman et al., [2005](#bib.bib87)). For example, bulge-dominated galaxies typically
    have assembly histories that are richer in mergers (e.g. Conselice, [2006](#bib.bib20)),
    with the strength of the bulge correlating with the number of mergers (e.g. Hatton
    et al., [2003](#bib.bib38)). In comparison, the presence of a disc at the present
    day is a signature of a more quiescent formation history, with the buildup of
    stellar mass likely to be driven mainly by gas accretion and secular processes
    (Codis et al., [2012](#bib.bib18); Kaviraj, [2014a](#bib.bib53); Martin et al.,
    [2018b](#bib.bib73)). In a similar vein, at a given stellar mass, lower surface
    brightnesses or redder colours may indicate a larger role for tidal processes,
    like interactions and ram-pressure stripping, in the evolution of the galaxy in
    question (e.g. Dressler, [1980](#bib.bib28); Moore et al., [1999](#bib.bib79);
    Weisz et al., [2011](#bib.bib116); Martin et al., [2019](#bib.bib74)). Finally,
    morphological details, such as extended tidal features, are signposts of recent
    mergers and/or strong interactions (e.g. Kaviraj, [2014b](#bib.bib54); Kaviraj
    et al., [2019](#bib.bib55)), with the surface-brightness of these tidal features
    typically scaling with the mass ratios of the mergers in question (e.g. Peirani
    et al., [2010](#bib.bib84); Kaviraj, [2010](#bib.bib52)).

- en: In addition to its key role in the study of galaxy evolution, morphological
    information is useful for a vast array of astrophysical science. For example,
    it is used as a prior in photometric-redshift pipelines (e.g. Soo et al., [2018](#bib.bib102);
    Menou, [2018](#bib.bib76)), forms key contextual data in the classification of
    transient lightcurves (e.g. Djorgovski et al., [2012](#bib.bib27); Wollaeger et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib119)) and is important for identifying the processes that trigger
    the onset of AGN activity in galaxies (e.g. Schawinski et al., [2014](#bib.bib93)).
    The measurement of accurate galaxy morphologies, particularly in large surveys
    which underpin our statistical endeavour is, therefore, a critical exercise.

- en: Over the past few decades a rich literature has emerged on methods for measuring
    galaxy morphology, especially in large observational surveys. These methods range
    from parametric techniques, which attempt to describe galaxy light profiles using
    small sets of parameters (e.g. Sérsic, [1963](#bib.bib96); Simard et al., [2002](#bib.bib97);
    Odewahn et al., [2002](#bib.bib80); Lackner & Gunn, [2012](#bib.bib61)), to non-parametric
    methods that reduce these light distributions to single values such as in the
    ‘CAS’ system (e.g. Abraham et al., [1994](#bib.bib1); Conselice, [2003](#bib.bib19);
    Menanteau et al., [2006](#bib.bib75)), the Gini-M[20] coefficients (e.g. Lotz
    et al., [2004](#bib.bib68); Scarlata et al., [2007](#bib.bib92); Peth et al.,
    [2016](#bib.bib85)) or other non-parametric statistics such as the MID system
    (e.g. Freeman et al., [2013](#bib.bib34)). Recent work has increasingly harnessed
    the power of machine-learning to perform morphological analysis. Although the
    use of machine-learning in astronomy can be traced back at least as far as Lahav
    et al. ([1995](#bib.bib62)), the recent literature has seen an explosion in the
    use of such techniques applied to a wide variety of problems in astrophysics (e.g.
    Huertas-Company et al., [2015a](#bib.bib45); Ostrovski et al., [2017](#bib.bib83);
    Schawinski et al., [2017](#bib.bib94); Hocking et al., [2018](#bib.bib43); Goulding

    are particularly well-suited to efficiently processing large survey datasets,
    they are typically benchmarked against visual inspection (e.g. Kaviraj, [2010](#bib.bib52);
    Lintott et al., [2011](#bib.bib66); Simmons et al., [2017](#bib.bib98)), which
    produces arguably the most powerful and accurate measures of galaxy morphology.
    While time-consuming to perform, the development of the Galaxy Zoo (GZ; Lintott
    et al., [2011](#bib.bib66)) platform has, in recent years, revolutionized the
    collection of visual classifications for large surveys. Using more than a million
    citizen-science volunteers, GZ has classified several contemporary surveys, like
    the SDSS and the HST legacy surveys (e.g. Lintott et al., [2011](#bib.bib66);
    Willett et al., [2017](#bib.bib117)). Automated methods, especially those that
    exploit machine-learning, have been routinely benchmarked against visual classifications
    from databases like GZ, and are now commonly deployed on large-scale survey data
    (e.g. Huertas-Company et al., [2015a](#bib.bib45); Dieleman et al., [2015](#bib.bib26);
    Beck et al., [2018](#bib.bib8); Walmsley et al., [2019](#bib.bib114); Ma et al.,

    e.g. from the LSST, present unprecedented challenges for performing morphological
    classification (Robertson et al., [2017](#bib.bib89)). The sheer volume of data
    makes such surveys intractable for visual inspection, even via massively-distributed
    platforms like GZ. New techniques, which either combine visual and automated classification
    (e.g. Beck et al., [2018](#bib.bib8); Dickinson et al., [2019](#bib.bib25)) or
    perhaps remove the need for visual classification altogether (e.g. Siudek et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib99); Hocking et al., [2018](#bib.bib43); Hendel et al., [2018](#bib.bib39);
    D’Isanto et al., [2018](#bib.bib24)), will be crucial in dealing with the unprecedented
    data volumes expected from these new surveys. The short cadence of rapidly-changing
    datasets, from instruments like the LSST, represents an additional hurdle and
    could make supervised machine-learning techniques challenging to deploy, as it
    may become impractical to repeatedly produce large, reliable training sets on
    short timescales, as the survey becomes progressively deeper.

- en: Unsupervised machine-learning (UML) algorithms are ideally suited to the morphological
    analysis of Big Data surveys. Unsupervised techniques do not require visually-classified
    training sets and can, in principle, rapidly and autonomously compress an arbitrarily
    large galaxy population into a small number of ‘morphological clusters’ comprised
    of galaxies with similar properties (e.g. Hocking et al., [2018](#bib.bib43)).
    These groups can then be benchmarked against visual classification which, if the
    number of groups is relatively small, becomes tractable even for individual researchers
    (and can be tackled easily using distributed systems like GZ).

    with the HSC-SSP DR1 catalogue, explore the robustness of these classifications
    and discuss the applicability of the algorithm to surveys from forthcoming instruments
    like LSST (whose deep-wide-fast dataset will reach the same depth as the HSC-SSP
    Ultradeep survey after $\sim$10 years). We also plan to release catalogues of
    morphological classifications based on both forthcoming HSC-SSP data releases
    and datasets from future instruments like LSST will be released as data becomes

    The primary application of this algorithm is to provide a means of efficiently
    classifying large quantities of unseen data into small groups of visually similar
    objects, so that the groups can be benchmarked against visual classifications.
    The ability to do so quickly, without relying on pre-existing training sets, is

    the new parameter spaces it will explore will make it challenging to construct

    of objects, separated into different morphological clusters, show consistency
    in terms of their basic properties and structural parameters (magnitude, M[20],
    colours), as well as strong concordance with classification data from GZ (e.g.
    smoothness, disciness etc). Separately, the algorithm has been shown to efficiently
    separate ellipticals and spirals, when benchmarked against expert human classifiers,

    to reduce the time that the algorithm takes to run, and to avoid including pixels
    that contain no useful information, we only extract pixels that are $1\sigma$
    above the noise level, determined by a simple sigma-clipping (e.g. as implemented
    by Bertin & Arnouts, [1996](#bib.bib9); Robitaille et al., [2013](#bib.bib90),

    It is important that the patch size is large enough to sample the spatial scales
    over which the data varies (e.g. that it is larger than the PSF). Other common

    Coates et al., [2011](#bib.bib17); Cheriyadat, [2013](#bib.bib16); Tao et al.,
    [2015](#bib.bib108)) could also be used. While it is possible that this approach
    could produce better results, such an approach would also produce outputs that
    are difficult to interpret. Additionally, this could have significant implications
    for the speed of the algorithm, as it would introduce an additional learning step
    and also increase the dimensionality of the feature space that must be explored
    in later steps. This could potentially significantly increase the time required
    to produce classifications. Since we aim to be able to quickly and repeatedly
    produce classifications for rapidly changing datasets (e.g. from the LSST), and
    produce outputs where each step can be easily validated by human inspection, slowing
    down the algorithm and obfuscating the outputs in not desirable, even if it produces
    an improvement in the quality of the classifications.

    of the extraction and classification steps, the algorithm performs well on large
    datasets. For example, the entire 3.5 deg² of the HSC Ultradeep dataset used in
    this paper was processed in under 40 CPU hours, including feature selection, extraction
    and classification. Scaling up to much larger data volumes will also be possible.
    For example, under the conservative assumption that 1 per cent of the approximately
    $10^{12}$ pixels that make up the SDSS are detected, the entirety of SDSS could
    be processed in under 3000 CPU hours (assuming a modeling/feature extraction step
    has already been performed). Assuming the same set of assumptions for LSST (although
    LSST images will have more detected pixels than SDSS due to greater depth), the
    smaller pixel size and larger area of LSST would require around 16,000 CPU hours.

    to effectively separate stars from galaxies (Fadely et al., [2012](#bib.bib33)).
    However, the algorithm employed here is able to distinguish between stars and
    resolved galaxies, even within the region where they share the same colours, because
    resolved galaxies and unresolved stars do not share the same (spatial) power spectra
    or distribution of patch types, and therefore, do not fall into the same morphological
    clusters.

    (as described in Section [4.1](#S4.SS1 "4.1 Benchmarking of morphological clusters
    via visual classification ‣ 4 Morphological catalogue ‣ Galaxy morphological classification
    in deep-wide surveys via unsupervised machine learning")) to determine extendedness
    is not always a good proxy for stellarity. Although star-galaxy separation has
    traditionally used purely morphometric information to classify stars and galaxies
    in optical survey data (e.g. Kron, [1980](#bib.bib60); Eisenstein et al., [2001](#bib.bib31);
    Henrion et al., [2011](#bib.bib40)), new ground-based deep-wide surveys, which
    contain many more unresolved galaxies than stars at faint apparent magnitudes
    (Fadely et al., [2012](#bib.bib33); Soumagnac et al., [2015](#bib.bib103)), represent
    an emerging challenge. Further work is therefore needed in order to determine
    whether the algorithm can effectively distinguish faint, unresolved galaxies from
    stars in very deep images. We note, however, that this does not affect the analysis
    in this study, since we are focused on bright objects.

    (i.e. more than 50 per cent) of objects in the Ultradeep survey have large enough
    sizes for robust morphological classification using the graph-clustering algorithm.
    We note that this cut appears to vary as a function of galaxy morphology, as demonstrated
    by the brighter limiting magnitudes for some morphologies, particularly for ellipticals.
    This is likely the result of different average projected sizes, with ellipticals
    being typically more compact than spiral galaxies that have similar magnitudes,
    particularly at low luminosities (e.g. Lange et al., [2015](#bib.bib63)). In the
    subsequent figures in this section, we consider galaxies brighter than this $m_{i}=22.5$ mag
    threshold. We also show that the size criterion imposed by the algorithm does

    et al., [2010](#bib.bib47); Conselice et al., [2014](#bib.bib22)), there is a
    general trend for elliptical and S0/Sa fractions at a given stellar mass to increase
    towards lower redshifts. These systems increasingly dominate the number density
    at high stellar masses towards the present day (e.g. Wilman & Erwin, [2012](#bib.bib118);
    Kelvin et al., [2014](#bib.bib56)), as spiral galaxies are quenched to form S0/Sa
    systems and/or undergo morphological transformation via mergers to form ellipticals.
    In the highest redshift bin ($0.7<z<0.9$), ellipticals almost entirely dominate
    at masses greater than $10^{11}$M[⊙], whereas S0/Sa galaxies become more important
    in the same mass range towards lower redshifts.

- en: While S0/Sa galaxies and ellipticals share similar mass functions, at least
    at lower redshifts, the dominance of ellipticals at high stellar mass in the early
    Universe indicates that a distinct, more gradual, evolutionary channel may be
    responsible for producing the S0/Sa populations. In particular, ellipticals likely
    form at epochs that predate those where the mechanisms that produce S0/Sa populations
    (e.g. Dressler et al., [1997](#bib.bib29); Cerulo et al., [2017](#bib.bib14);
    Oh et al., [2019](#bib.bib81)) are most efficient. This is likely to be particularly
    true for the most massive ellipticals, which must have formed rapidly at high
    or intermediate redshift (e.g. Jaffé et al., [2011](#bib.bib48); Tomczak et al.,
    [2014](#bib.bib110); Huertas-Company et al., [2015b](#bib.bib46)).

    over redshift and is already in place in the highest redshift bin. The S0/Sa mass
    function appears instead to be built up from lower-mass systems, indicating a
    different evolutionary channel from their elliptical counterparts. At all redshifts,
    S0/Sa type galaxies typically dominate at intermediate masses, between spirals
    and ellipticals (e.g. Vulcani et al., [2011](#bib.bib113); Kelvin et al., [2014](#bib.bib56)),
    with the peak of the S0/Sa fraction moving towards lower stellar masses at lower
    redshifts.

    objects of different morphology can fall into the same regions of parameter space,

    exists in the integrated properties of S0/Sa galaxies, spirals and ellipticals,

    also in physical properties like stellar mass and SFR. Such integrated properties

    spatial distribution of patch types across each object, are essential ingredients
    of accurate morphological classification.

- en: Morphology is a fundamental quantity that encodes the principal mechanisms that
    drive the evolution of individual galaxies. Essential for the full spectrum of
    galaxy-evolution studies, morphology is an important parameter for an array of
    topics in astrophysics, e.g. as a prior in photometric redshift pipelines and
    as contextual data in transient lightcurve classifications. A rich literature
    exists on morphological-classification techniques, with methods ranging from automated
    classification (e.g. via parametric and non-parametric reductions of galaxy images
    and machine-learning techniques) to direct visual classification by human classifiers,
    which is typically used to benchmark automated algorithms.

- en: Notwithstanding the array of techniques on offer, the forthcoming era of ‘Big
    Data’ deep-wide surveys poses unique challenges for measuring galaxy morphologies.
    The sheer volume of data expected from surveys like LSST and Euclid makes visual
    classification intractable for such datasets (even via massively-distributed systems
    like Galaxy Zoo) and makes some degree of automation essential for this exercise.
    The short cadence of surveys like LSST presents an additional challenge, because
    repeatedly producing training sets, that are required for supervised machine-learning
    techniques, on short timescales may be impractical.

    and an ideal route for the morphological classification of galaxies in next-generation
    surveys. An effective UML algorithm can autonomously compress an arbitrarily large
    galaxy population into a small set of morphological clusters whose members have
    similar morphology. If the number of clusters is small enough (e.g in the hundreds
    or less), then this makes it tractable to benchmark them using visual classification
    by individual researchers. The resultant classifications can thus combine both
    the speed of automation and the accuracy of visual classification.

    distinct groups of galaxy types from survey pixel data, to separate galaxies in
    the HSC-SSP DR1 Ultradeep layer into 160 morphological clusters. This technique
    extracts sub-image patches from multi-band HSC data, each of which are transformed
    into a rotationally-invariant representation of a small region of the survey data,
    efficiently encoding colour, intensity and spatial frequency information. Utilising
    growing neural gas and hierarchical clustering algorithms, it then groups patches
    into a library of patch types, based on their similarity, and assembles feature
    vectors for each object, which describe the frequency of each patch type. A $k$-means
    algorithm is then used to separate objects into morphological clusters, based
    on the similarity of their feature vectors.

    features (e.g. when spirals appear unusually red or show clumpy structure, or
    when elliptical galaxies appear unusually blue). To test the robustness of the
    classifications, we have shown that galaxies in different morphological classes

    forthcoming deep-wide surveys. The combination of initial UML-driven automation,
    followed by benchmarking via visual classification, is likely to become an optimal
    tool for the morphological analysis of surveys like LSST. While this study has
    focused on bright galaxies at $z<1$, it is worth noting that a significant fraction
    of objects, especially at low masses, inhabit the low-surface-brightness (LSB)
    Universe (e.g. Martin et al., [2019](#bib.bib74)). In forthcoming work, we will
    optimize the algorithm for the morphological classification of LSB galaxies and
    the detection of LSB structures, such as faint merger-induced tidal features,
    which will be routinely detectable in future surveys like those from the LSST.
    Furthermore, while our morphological classifications are limited to $z<1$, due
    to the ground-based nature of the HSC images, implementation of this UML algorithm
    on forthcoming higher-resolution data, e.g. from Euclid, will enable virtually
    all-sky morphological classification of galaxies out to high redshift.

    HSC-SSP DR1 centroids ‣ Galaxy morphological classification in deep-wide surveys
    via unsupervised machine learning") shows the cumulative frequency of objects
    detected by the algorithm within a single tract of HSC-SSP data, as a function
    of of their size. The size of each object is measured by the number of pixels
    it consists of, which is determined by the number of connected components above
    the sigma-clipping level in each object. The grey dashed histogram shows the cumulative
    number of objects larger than 10 pixels detected by the algorithm. The blue solid
    histogram indicates the cumulative number of these objects whose centroids can
    be matched to objects in the HSC-SSP DR1 catalogue within $0.8^{\prime\prime}$.
    Although the number of objects successfully matched is close to the total number
    of objects detected by the algorithm for small sizes ($n_{\mathrm{pixels}}\lesssim
    50$), objects with larger sizes are significantly less likely to be matched.

- en: The mismatch between centroids becomes a significant problem for large objects,
    with almost no objects with sizes larger than 200 pixels being matched. We note,
    however, that this mismatch does not present a significant problem for our analysis,
    as we consider only intermediate redshift ($z>0.3$) objects, which typically have
    small sizes. It would, however, be advantageous to select detected pixels from
    the object footprints taken directly from a catalogue that we hope to match to
    (i.e. in this case, from the stacked calexp images from HSC-SSP DR1) – as discussed
    at the beginning of Section [5](#S5 "5 Galaxy properties as a function of morphological
    type ‣ Galaxy morphological classification in deep-wide surveys via unsupervised
    machine learning"). This is likely to yield more reliable cross-matching, especially
    for large, nearby objects and might be necessary for a perfect one-to-one matching.

    Table [5](#A2.T5 "Table 5 ‣ Appendix B Released data products - lists of morphological

    clusters with their associated visual classifications and median values of key
    galaxy properties within the cluster (surface-brightness, stellar mass, specific
    SFR, rest-frame $(g-r)$ colour and absolute $r$-band magnitude). Table [6](#A2.T6
    "Table 6 ‣ Appendix B Released data products - lists of morphological clusters
    and individual galaxy properties ‣ Galaxy morphological classification in deep-wide
    surveys via unsupervised machine learning") (only the first ten rows are shown
    here) provides a list of individual HSC-SSP galaxies with their associated morphological
    cluster IDs and ancillary information. As noted above, users should discard objects
    which are classified as not extended, as they are likely to be stars.
