- en: We inspect all the deep learning based solutions and provide holistic understanding
    of various architectures that have evolved over the past few years to solve blind
    deblurring. The introductory work used deep learning to estimate some features
    of the blur kernel and then moved onto predicting the blur kernel entirely, which
    converts the problem into non-blind deblurring. The recent state of the art techniques
    are end to end i.e they don’t estimate the blur kernel rather try to estimate
    the latent sharp image directly from the blurred image. The benchmarking PSNR
    and SSIM values on standard datasets of GOPRO and Köhler using various architectures
    are also provided.

- en: Present day imaging systems for instance consumer level photography cameras,
    medical imaging equipments, scientific astronomical imaging systems, microscopy
    and more may experience blurring due to various intrinsic (diffraction, lens chromatic
    aberration, anti-aliasing filters etc.) or extrinsic (object motion, camera shake,
    out of focus, atmospheric turbulence etc.) factors which results in loss of image
    information. To overcome this problem and to recover lost information, deblurring
    is of great interest. From an artistic perspective blur is sometimes intentional
    in photography but for majority of the image analysis applications blurs ruins
    useful data.

    $M$. After getting the motion field $M$ this becomes a non-blind debluring problem
    and a deconvolution is used to get the sharp image.

- en: 'Deblurring requires a large receptive field (global knowledge), but CNNs provide
    local knowledge and do not show the long range dependencies properly, for this
    reason Nah et. al[[4](#bib.bib4)] (refer [II-B2](#S2.SS2.SSS2 "II-B2 With Adversarial
    Loss ‣ II-B End to End ‣ II Methods ‣ Blind Deblurring using Deep Learning: A
    Survey *denotes equal contribution")) uses a scaled structure and a large number
    of convolutional layers with residual connections to improve the receptive field
    of the structure, but this also makes it harder to converge due to the large number
    of parameters. Hence (Tao et. al.[[9](#bib.bib9)]) use a scale recurrent structure
    where they still use a scaled network, but significantly reduce the number of
    parameters by using a smaller encoder-decoder type network with a recurrent module
    and also share the weights between scales.'

    layers both the blurred image $B^{i}$ and the restored image of the previous scale
    $L^{i-1\uparrow}$ are concatenated and both are sent as input. The encoder module

    convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) which gave the best results. They also trained a
    network without any Recurrent module and it gave lower performance compared to
    the one which included a recurrent module. It takes as input the hidden features
    of the previous scale’s recurrent module $h^{i-1\uparrow}$ and the features generated
    by the current scales encoder $f^{i}$. The hidden features of the previous scale
    passes the intermediate results and blur patterns of the previous scale which
    benefits the current scale. Gradient clipping is used for this module only. It
    gives as output a modified set of features $g^{i}$ and the hidden features of
    the current scale $h^{i}$.

    previously used in the classical methods. The key idea of this pyramid structure
    is that the downsampled version of the blurred image has less amount of blur and
    it is easier for removal. Hence the goal of each respective network (or stage)
    is to mitigate the blur effect at that corresponding scale. It also helps break
    down the complex problem of deblurring into smaller units.'

- en: The problem in this architecture is when there are extreme blurs,the network
    leaves the images untouched but it does not suffer from artifacts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spatially variant blurs in dynamic scenes require a large receptive field, while
    CNN have a local knowledge (small receptive field) and spatially invariant weights,
    to remove this problem they have to use larger networks with more convolutional
    layer, leading to more parameters which is difficult to train. Hence, the challenge
    is to have a small architecture with a large receptive field, to this end Zhang
    et. al[[10](#bib.bib10)] proposes the use of Recurrent Neural Network as a deconvolutional
    operator which increases the receptive field (long range dependencies).

- en: 'The network proposed by Zhang et. al.[[10](#bib.bib10)] uses three CNN and
    one RNN. The CNN are used for feature extraction, image reconstruction, and pixel-wise
    weight generation (for the RNN). While the RNN is used as a deconvolutional operator
    with a large receptive field (Fig. [8](#S2.F8 "Figure 8 ‣ II-B1 Without Adversarial
    Loss ‣ II-B End to End ‣ II Methods ‣ Blind Deblurring using Deep Learning: A
    Survey *denotes equal contribution")). Weight generation for the RNN is done by
    passing an image through a encoder-decoder architecture CNN. For both the decoder
    part of the weight generation module and the image restoration module they use
    bilinear interpolation (no deconvolution) to avoid checkerboard artifact [[11](#bib.bib11)]
    The RNN generates receptive fields in one direction (single dimension), hence
    they use a convolutional layer after every RNN to fuse the receptive fields together
    to get a two dimensional structure. Skip connections are added to avoid vanishing
    gradient problem and for faster training.'

    Adversarial Networks [[14](#bib.bib14)][[15](#bib.bib15)][[16](#bib.bib16)]. The
    approach Generative Adversarial Networks take is to have two different agents
    play a game against each other. One of the agents is a generator network which
    tries to generate data and the other is a discriminator network which examines
    data and checks whether it came from the real distribution (ground truth sharp
    image) or model distribution (restored blurred image). The goal of the generator
    is to fool the discriminator into believing that its output is from the real distribution.
    These generator and discriminator modules are neural networks whose parameters
    can be tuned by backpropagation and as both players get better at their job over
    time eventually the generator is forced to create data as realistic as possible.

    because convolution can only capture local information, hence lower resolution
    images are used to capture the long range dependencies, whereas the high resolution
    images are used to capture the fine grained details. Each of these scaled blurred
    images passes through a layer of multiple convolutional and residual blocks (residual
    blocks enable training in large networks without over fitting) to generate the
    corresponding latent image for that scale, then for each scale MSE(Mean Squared

    but the generator uses a structure similar to DenseNet[[17](#bib.bib17)] with
    a global skip connection. Similar to Nah et. al.[[4](#bib.bib4)], here dimensions
    are maintained throughout the convolutional layers, so that no deconvolution module
    needs to be used, preventing checkerboard effect [[11](#bib.bib11)]. Using a densely
    connected CNN in generator reduces the vanishing gradient problem, strengthens
    feature propagation and reuse and reduces the number of parameters, all of which
    in turn allows us to use a smaller network with smoother training and faster inference
    time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generator is divided into three parts, head, dense field and tail. Head
    creates sufficient activations for the dense field using convolutional layer.
    The dense field consists of several dense blocks, each dense block has a ReLU
    to add non linearity, a 1$\times$1 convolution to limit the number of activaitons
    (or channels), a convolutional layer (3 $\times$ 3), and batch normalizations.
    In DenseNet[[17](#bib.bib17)] $l^{th}$ layer of convolution is connected to the
    features of all the previous layers as opposed to the immediately previous layer
    (like in classic CNN). This dense connectivity is achieved in the generator by
    concatenating the output of $l^{th}$ layer with the output of $(l+1)^{th}$ layer,
    which in turn concatenates its output with the output of next layer i.e $(l+2)^{th}$
    layer and so on. All the convolutional layers in the dense filed use spatial and
    dilated convolution alternatively, this increases the receptive field of the network
    while still restraining the number of parameters to be learned. The rate of dilation
    increases till the middle layer and then decreases till the tail is reached. Tail
    adds non-linearity and uses $1\times 1$ convolution to reduce the number of activations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They added the output of head to the output of tail to form a global skip connection,
    this allows gradients to flow back to the first layers of convolution which helps
    in learning (gradient updates) of the lower layers. Shorter connections between
    layers close to the output and layers close to the input, results in better accuracy
    and efficiency.

    (taken from end layers of a pretrained VGG16 network) of the predicted and sharp

- en: We observe that end-to-end methods ([[3](#bib.bib3)], [[4](#bib.bib4)], [[6](#bib.bib6)],
    [[5](#bib.bib5)], [[9](#bib.bib9)], [[10](#bib.bib10)]) have higher PSNR and SSIM
    compared to methods that estimate the blur kernel ([[2](#bib.bib2)], [[8](#bib.bib8)]),
    this is because an error in kernel estimation can lead to various artifacts in
    image, degrading the restoration.

- en: We also observed that most of the methods tried to increase their receptive
    field, which allowed long range spatial dependencies, essential for non uniform
    blurs.

    resulting in faster inference, as it can be clearly seen in (Table [III](#S3.T3
    "TABLE III ‣ III-C GoPro Dataset ‣ III Performance Evaluation ‣ Blind Deblurring
    using Deep Learning: A Survey *denotes equal contribution")) that Nah et. al.[[4](#bib.bib4)]
    which has a large network size is slower compared to other networks.'

    one of the biggest challenge in learning based deblurring methods.
