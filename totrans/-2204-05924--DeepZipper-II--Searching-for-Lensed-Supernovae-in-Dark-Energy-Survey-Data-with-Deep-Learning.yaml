- en: 'Gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are important probes of cosmic expansion,
    but they remain rare and difficult to find. Current cosmic surveys likely contain
    5-10 LSNe in total while next-generation experiments are expected to contain several
    hundreds to a few thousands of these systems. We search for these systems in observed
    Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year SN fields – 10 3-sq. deg. regions of sky imaged
    in the $griz$ bands approximately every six nights over five years. To perform
    the search, we utilize the DeepZipper approach: a multi-branch deep learning architecture
    trained on image-level simulations of LSNe that simultaneously learns spatial
    and temporal relationships from time series of images. We find that our method
    obtains a LSN recall of 61.13% and a false positive rate of 0.02% on the DES SN
    field data. DeepZipper selected 2,245 candidates from a magnitude-limited ($m_{i}$
    $<$ 22.5) catalog of 3,459,186 systems. We employ human visual inspection to review
    systems selected by the network and find three candidate LSNe in the DES SN fields.'

- en: Galaxy-scale gravitational lensing occurs when the gravitational potential of
    a foreground galaxy (positioned along an observer’s line of sight to a background
    galaxy) is large enough to deflect the photons of the background galaxy on their
    journey to an observer. This process produces arcs and/or multiple images of the
    background galaxy (Treu, [2010](#bib.bib40)). For the specific case in which the
    background galaxy contains a supernova (SN), the photons that contribute to each
    of the multiple images of the lensed supernova (LSN) travel different paths and
    distances to the observer and encounter different depths of gravitational potential
    depending on the distribution of the foreground galaxy’s mass. Because the speed
    of light is constant, the distinct paths correspond to distinct arrival times
    of the photons from each SN image. Combining this time delay with a model of the
    foreground galaxy’s mass distribution enables the direct inference of the rate
    of expansion of the Universe today $H_{0}$, as well as other cosmological parameters
    (Refsdal, [1964](#bib.bib35)).

- en: Historically, LSNe are rare — only a few detections have been made in total
    (Kelly et al., [2015](#bib.bib20); Rodney et al., [2021](#bib.bib36); Goobar et al.,
    [2017](#bib.bib11); Amanullah et al., [2011](#bib.bib4); Quimby et al., [2014](#bib.bib34);
    Rodney et al., [2015](#bib.bib37)). However, modern optical time-domain survey
    datasets, such as those collected in the southern hemisphere by the Dark Energy
    Survey’s SN fields (DES; Abbott et al., [2016](#bib.bib1); Diehl, [2020](#bib.bib9)),
    in the northern hemisphere by the Zwicky Transient Facility (Graham et al., [2019](#bib.bib12))
    and the Young Supernova Experiment (Jones et al., [2021](#bib.bib19)), and over
    the next decade by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and
    Time (LSST; Ivezić et al., [2019](#bib.bib18)), are promising places to search
    for LSNe. Based on imaging depth, sky area, and duration of observations, the
    DES SN fields are expected to contain $\sim 0.5-2$ LSNe, and the LSST wide field
    is expected to contain $\sim 2,000$ LSNe (Oguri, [2019](#bib.bib31)). These datasets,
    which contain hundreds of millions to tens of billions of objects that are not
    LSNe, pose a significant challenge for searches (Abbott et al., [2021](#bib.bib3);
    Marshall et al., [2017](#bib.bib24)). In particular, it is vital to identify an
    LSN rapidly to enable follow-up observations before the SN fades during the weeks
    to months after the explosion (Mihalas, [1963](#bib.bib26)). To keep pace with
    the data streams of large surveys and identify candidate LSNe promptly, we require
    fast and robust algorithms.

    designed a deep learning detection architecture (“ZipperNet”) for LSNe and demonstrated
    its performance on four simulated optical survey datasets that mimic DES and LSST.
    In this work, we use a ZipperNet to search the DES SN fields (Abbott et al., [2021](#bib.bib3))
    for LSNe.We also discuss the data collection and data reduction steps necessary
    to carry out a comprehensive LSN search in an optical survey dataset. We have

- en: We begin our search for candidate LSNe with all cataloged objects of DES Data
    Release 1 (also referred to as the “Year 3 Gold Catalog”) (Abbott et al., [2018](#bib.bib2)).
    We construct an initial sample by requiring the object to be positioned within
    one of the SN fields and requiring all $griz$ MAG_AUTO measurements to be brighter
    than 27.5 mag. Then, within that sample, we require the $i$ band MAG_AUTO only
    to be brighter than 22.5 mag to restrict the total number of objects in this first
    search of the DES SN fields. Also within the initial sample, we require a catalog-level
    parameter size measurement (CM_T) to be greater than 0.05, which excludes non-extended
    objects (e.g., stars) with approximately 99% galaxy purity and 98% galaxy completeness.
    To evaluate the purity and completeness, we take a nearest-neighbor machine learning
    classifier that combines DES photometry with near-infrared photometry as truth,
    which has shown near-perfect performance at mag${}_{i}<22.5$ (Hartley et al.,
    [2021](#bib.bib15)). These cuts produce a sample of 3,459,186 candidate systems
    for our analysis.

    If a system has two images on the same night in the same band, we choose the image
    for which the object was observed with the better seeing. For each image, we also
    require the cataloged object’s centroid to be positioned more than 23 pixels from
    all CCD edges: this permits constructing image cutouts (45 pixel by 45 pixel)
    without producing partial images. Finally, to enforce cadence uniformity and simplify
    data processing, we require the same number of observations in each of the $griz$
    bands. We determine the band with the fewest useful observations and exclude images
    from the other bands to match it. In doing so, we exclude images from regions
    of the time series in descending order of the sampling rate. Thus, for each candidate
    lens galaxy in the SN fields selected from the DES catalog, we obtain a time series
    image set with the same number of images in each band of $griz$. A typical length
    for a time series image set is $\sim 20-35$ epochs. We process each year of DES

- en: Our approach for detecting LSNe in the DES deep fields requires samples of LSNe
    (positives) and non-LSNe (negatives) to train the ZipperNet in a binary classification
    scheme. To construct the training set, we used $\sim 2$% of the total dataset
    – 76,203 time series image sets. Due to the lack of real LSN examples, we create
    the positive class by using gravitational lensing simulation software (deeplenstronomy;
    Morgan et al., [2021](#bib.bib29)) to add LSNe to DES images in the training set.
    For the negative class, we use time series image sets selected at random from
    the dataset. Even given the erroneous case where a real LSN is randomly selected
    for the negative training class, LSNe are expected to be sufficiently rare in
    the DES SN fields such that this error would be infrequent and not affect the
    training. Nevertheless, the two most likely types of false positives will be non-lensed
    SNe and strongly lensed galaxies without SNe; and unfortunately, both these types
    of systems are also expected to be rare in our dataset. Therefore, to prepare
    a training set with boosted representation of systems that we expect to be more
    challenging to classify, we also use deeplenstronomy to inject lensed source galaxies
    and non-lensed supernovae into a fraction of the negative-class images.

    sets has multiple benefits. The training dataset includes all types of astronomical
    systems that the ZipperNet will classify because it is chosen from the total dataset.
    Also, the properties of the simulated source galaxies and SNe are drawn from real
    data, maintaining all inherent physical correlations. We join the DES Year 3 Gold
    catalog and DES Year 1 morphological catalog (Tarsitano et al., [2018](#bib.bib39))
    to obtain a sample of $\sim 100,000$ galaxies from which we draw parameter values
    for simulations. The simulated source galaxies are modeled with Sersic light profiles
    that have a color-independent ellipticity, a Sersic profile index, a band-wise
    half-light radius, a band-wise magnitude, and a photometric redshift — all measured
    within DES pipelines. As in DZ1, the injected SNe were simulated using public
    rest frame SN spectral energy distributions (Kessler et al., [2010](#bib.bib21))
    available in deeplenstronomy, which redshifts the distribution and calculates
    the observed magnitude in each band. The injected SNe reach peak brightness within
    the interval of 20 days before the first observation and 20 days after the final
    observation: the dataset contains falling-only ($\sim 15\%$), rising-only ($\sim
    15\%$), and complete lightcurves ($\sim 70\%$).'

    light, we use the measured photometric redshift of the lens galaxy, select an
    Einstein radius at random from the interval $[0.4\arcsec,1.8\arcsec]$, and model
    the mass distribution of the lens as a singular isothermal ellipsoid following
    similar approaches in the literature (Rojas et al., [2021](#bib.bib38)). For simplicity,
    the mass distribution shares the measured center position and ellipticity values
    with the light from the real lens galaxy. This simplification is not expected
    to greatly affect performance because these parameters are expected to be positively
    correlated. From the mass profile, we calculate the lensed positions of the source
    galaxy and LSN, as well as account for the time delays of the separate SN images.
    The output of the deeplenstronomy simulation are time series image sets with three
    kinds of objects added to real DES images – LSNe, lensed source galaxies, and
    non-lensed SNe.

    a series of standardization steps. We first truncate the time series image sets
    to 10 “time steps” in each band. A time step refers to a single exposure in the
    sequence of observations; in the DES SN fields, a time step is approximately 6-7
    days. If an image set contains more time steps, we separate it into multiple 10-time
    step sequences: time steps 1-10 are a single sequence; time steps 2-11 are a second
    sequence; etc. Then, for each 10-step image sequence, we extract the total brightness
    as a function of time using the background-subtracted aperture technique presented
    in DZ1 with an aperture radius of 15 pixels. Importantly, when extracting the
    total brightness, the zeropoint of the image is not used to maintain independence
    from all non-image data products. This choice produces noise-dominated extracted
    brightness lightcurves, such as those in Figure [1](#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Training
    Set Construction ‣ 3 Deep Learning Methods ‣ DeepZipper II: Searching for Lensed

    a per-example basis. The resulting input to the ZipperNet is two different kinds
    of data – 1) a scaled image in each of the $griz$ bands as a $4\times 45\times
    45$-element array and 2) a scaled 10-step lightcurve in each of the $griz$ bands
    as a $4\times 10$-element array. After processing the training dataset into 10-step
    sequences and downsampling to maintain equal representation of the positive and

    examples into 90% training and 10% validation datasets.

    into five equal chunks – each placed on an independent computer. On each computer,
    we instantiated a ZipperNet and initialized the weights at the same randomly selected
    values. We then begin passing the chunks of training data through the ZipperNet
    instances on each of the five computers. At regular intervals (every 1/15 of a
    chunk), we collect the parameters of each of the five ZipperNet instances and
    average the values of the parameters. Mathematically, the averaging operation
    is equivalent to the weights being updated by normal training, provided the learning
    rate is scaled by the number of network instances. Within this setup, we use a
    batch size of five examples and use stochastic gradient descent with a Nesterov

    linearly scale the ZipperNet output scores to the range $[0.0,1.0]$, such that
    they are similar to probabilities. Next, we select a threshold ZipperNet score
    above which we include the candidate system in our final sample and below which
    we exclude the candidate system. We select this threshold by iterating through
    possible threshold values and analyzing the fraction of LSNe that scored higher
    than the threshold compared to the fraction of galaxies that scored higher than

    LSN recall indicates that approximately 84% of all LSN in the validation dataset
    are scored above the operating threshold. The ZipperNet galaxy false positive
    rate indicates that roughly 1.5% of galaxies will be scored above our operating
    threshold and erroneously populate our candidate sample. By itself, the ZipperNet
    is a powerful classifier, but the minimized galaxy false positive rate is still
    large enough where the resulting candidate sample would be too large for visual
    inspection. With the addition of the selection criterion on the number of ZipperNet
    detections for each constituent subsequence, the performance is boosted. Critically,
    the final galaxy false positive rate is reduced, facilitating visual inspection
    of the full final candidate sample. This stricter selection has the consequence
    of reducing the final LSN recall. However, most of the removed LSNe are those
    that peak before or after the window of observations.

    could increase the LSN recall while decreasing the false positive rate. One such
    change is to add centroiding to account for sub-pixel-level shifts in position
    prior to stacking and averaging the images. While the offsets are small, misalignment
    at the $\approx 0.25$″ scale can cause image-based features to become less sharp
    and harder for a convolutional layer to identify. When stacking the images, it
    may also boost performance to only include the images with high image quality
    (e.g. seeing above some quality threshold and / or cloudiness below some quality
    threshold): this would ensure that the ability to resolve features in the resulting
    composite image is only limited by the instrumentation. These possibilities focus
    on improving the appearance of spatial features in the data to boost the ZipperNet’s
    ability to learn relationships and are motivated by the analysis of the physical
    selection function of our approach, which is described in Appendix [A.1](#A1.F1

    clarity of features in the lightcurves as a function of the aperture radius used
    in the lightcurve extraction may find that a different aperture radius leads to
    higher performance. It’s possible that scaling the time series image sets to have
    a standardized mean and a standardized variance of pixel value prior to preprocessing
    would lead to smoother lightcurves. Finally, the preprocessing steps used in this
    analysis down-selected images to standardize the cadence, though other approaches
    have demonstrated success with arbitrary numbers of images in the time series
    (Kodi Ramanah et al., [2022](#bib.bib23)). Removing the need for a standardized

    in angle and strength to the light profile. While there is likely to be a strong
    correlation between the mass and light profiles, the exclusion of training set
    examples with different relationships between mass profile ellipticity and light
    profile ellipticity may bias LSN selection to systems in which these quantities
    are highly correlated. We also employed a uniform distribution of Einstein radii,

    10-epoch sequence is created. There are two downsides to that approach: (1) there
    is an implicit requirement of 10 epochs before the trained ZipperNet can be utilized,
    and (2) our final selection criterion on the fraction of subsequences scored above
    the ZipperNet threshold requires additional epochs to create and track multiple
    subsequences. With the improvements to the preprocessing discussed above, it may
    be possible to sufficiently boost the ZipperNet performance to the point where
    the additional selection criterion can be removed. Furthermore, we did not experiment

    evidence of an LSN. While we do not confirm or further characterize these three
    systems of interest, they all contain lensing features and the presence of point
    sources as found during the human visual inspection. Full characterization would
    entail Scene Modeling Photometry (Brout et al., [2019](#bib.bib8)) to obtain lightcurves
    without host galaxy contamination, photometric classification of that time-series
    photometry, redshift measurements for all objects in the system, and lens modeling
    which are beyond the scope of this search. Because any detected LSNe would have
    faded by now, follow-up observations to confirm LSNe are unlikely to provide any
    additional information apart from redshifts. However, several of the systems of
    interest were detected by ZipperNet in multiple years throughout DES operations.
    Therefore, these persistent lensed systems with point sources offer interesting
    candidates for lensed quasar searches. The three most interesting candidates (DES-691022126,
    DES-701263907, and DES-699919273) are the most likely LSNe found by our ZipperNet

    to an observed optical survey dataset. The algorithm utilizes a novel neural network
    architecture called a ZipperNet that simultaneously learns characteristic features
    from image and temporal data to identify LSNe in DES data. Using a ZipperNet trained
    on simulated LSNe that are injected into the DES SN field data – along with a
    selection criterion on the number of detections for each system – our approach
    performs with an LSN recall of 61.13% and a false positive rate of 0.02%. This
    technique identified 2,245 candidate LSN systems in the DES SN fields, and a human
    visual inspection found 50 systems of interest, three of which contained evidence
    of a time-variable lensed source. Confirmation of these candidates of interest
    is left for future work, and these systems may facilitate direct measurements
    of $H_{0}$ when fully characterized. Looking to the Rubin Observatory era, the
    approach developed in DZ1 and implemented on the DES SN fields here has the potential
    to aid in the identification of several hundred LSNe.

    for the number of detections. In this section, we analyze four central properties
    to understand the selection function of our approach: the Einstein radius, the
    seeing, the brightness of the source galaxy, and the brightness of the LSN. The
    LSN recall is calculated as a function of these four properties in Figure [A.1](#A1.F1
    "Figure A.1 ‣ Appendix A Lensed SN Physical Selection Function ‣ DeepZipper II:
    Searching for Lensed Supernovae in Dark Energy Survey Data with Deep Learning").'

- en: We find that our approach has an easier time identifying larger Einstein radii
    than smaller Einstein radii. Similarly, we find that our approach has an easier
    time identifying LSNe in good seeing conditions than in average or poor seeing
    conditions. Both of these properties shed light the importance of the clarity
    of spatial features in the images. Poor seeing or small Einstein radii are both
    situations in which image resolution is compromised and consequently spatial features
    become difficult or impossible to realize. This trend in algorithm performance
    points to data quality characteristics as opposed to a selection bias introduced
    by our approach. Lastly, we find that source galaxy brightness has little impact
    on the performance for the range applicable to this magnitude-limited analysis.
    We observe a similar trend for LSNe brighter than 22 mag, but notice a reduction
    in performance for fainter LSNe. This magnitude threshold is near the single-epoch
    limiting magnitude for the DES SN fields and is likely due to Malmquist bias,
    but there could be second-order selection effects in the detectability of the
    LSN images.
