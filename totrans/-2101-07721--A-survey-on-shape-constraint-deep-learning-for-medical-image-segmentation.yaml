- en: Since the advent of U-Net, fully convolutional deep neural networks and its
    many variants have completely changed the modern landscape of deep learning based
    medical image segmentation. However, the over dependence of these methods on pixel
    level classification and regression has been identified early on as a problem.
    Especially when trained on medical databases with sparse available annotation,
    these methods are prone to generate segmentation artifacts such as fragmented
    structures, topological inconsistencies and islands of pixel. These artefacts
    are especially problematic in medical imaging since segmentation is almost always
    a pre-processing step for some downstream evaluation. The range of possible downstream
    evaluations is rather big, for example surgical planning, visualization, shape
    analysis, prognosis, treatment planning etc. However, one common thread across
    all these downstream tasks is the demand of anatomical consistency. To ensure
    the segmentation result is anatomically consistent, approaches based on Markov/
    Conditional Random Fields, Statistical Shape Models are becoming increasingly
    popular over the past 5 years. In this review paper, a broad overview of recent
    literature on bringing anatomical constraints for medical image segmentation is
    given, the shortcomings and opportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly
    discussed and potential future work is elaborated. We review the most relevant
    papers published until the submission date. For quick access, important details
    such as the underlying method, datasets and performance are tabulated.

- en: Semantic segmentation is the task of predicting the category of individual pixels
    in the image which has been one of the key problems in the field of image understanding
    and computer vision for a long time. It has a vast range of applications such
    as autonomous driving (detecting road signs, pedestrians and other road users),
    land use and land cover classification, image search engines, medical field (detecting
    and localizing the surgical instruments, describing the brain tumors, identifying
    organs in different image modalities). This problem has been tackled by a combination
    of machine learning and computer vision, approaches in the past. Despite their
    popularity and success, deep learning era changed main trends. Many of the problems
    in computer vision - semantic segmentation among them - have been solved with
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs) .

    has proven useful for obtaining more accurate and plausible results. The highly
    constrained nature of anatomical objects can be well captured with learning based
    techniques. However, in most recent and promising techniques such as CNN based
    segmentation it is not obvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge. Segmenting
    images that suffer from low-quality and low signal-to-noise ratio without any
    shape constraint remains problematic even for CNNs. Though it has been shown that
    incorporation of shape prior information significantly improves the performance
    of the segmentation algorithms, incorporation of such prior knowledge is a tricky
    practical problem. In this work, we provide an overview of efforts of shape prior
    usage in deep learning frameworks.

    deep learning for medical image segmentation in the recent past. McInerney and
    Terzopoulos ([1996](#bib.bib73)) presents various approaches that apply deformable
    models. Peng et al. ([2013](#bib.bib84)) deals with different categories of graph-based
    models where meaningful objects are represented by sub-graphs. The review by Heimann
    and Meinzer ([2009](#bib.bib42)) is about statistical shape models and concentrates
    especially on landmark-based shape representations. Elnakib et al. ([2011](#bib.bib28))
    also reviews different shape feature based models, that include statistical shape
    models, as well as deformable models. A more recent review by Nosrati and Hamarneh
    ([2016](#bib.bib82)) provides insights into segmentation models that incorporate
    shape information as prior knowledge. Later surveys of Litjens et al. ([2017](#bib.bib64)),
    Razzak et al. ([2017](#bib.bib89)), Rizwan I Haque and Neubert ([2020](#bib.bib91))
    and Lei et al. ([2020](#bib.bib58)) shift their focus to deep learning approaches.
    Hesamian et al. ([2019](#bib.bib43)) and Taghanaki et al. ([2019](#bib.bib100))
    present different network architectures and training techniques, whereas Jurdi
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib49)) take it a step further and reviews prior-based loss
    functions in neural networks.

- en: Since deep learning became the method of choice for many computer vision tasks,
    including medical image segmentation, we focus our review on models that combine
    neural networks with explicit shape models in order to incorporate shape knowledge
    into the segmentation process. Segmentation models solely based on neural networks
    usually do not incorporate any form of shape knowledge. They are based on traditional
    loss functions that only regard objects at pixel level and do not evaluate global
    structures. The papers we present in this review improve these networks by combining
    them with additional models that are especially built with shape in mind. This
    is also the point that delimits this review from existing surveys which either
    focus mostly deep learning approaches or on traditional shape and deformable model
    methods, but not on the combination of both.

    as shown in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1.1 Yet another review paper ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ A survey on shape-constraint deep learning for medical image segmentation"):
    1) Conditional or Markov Field models that establish connections between different
    pixel regions 2) Active/Statistical Shape Models that learn a special representation
    for valid shapes 3) Active Contour Models or snakes that use deformable splines
    for shape detection. These models are either applied as pre-processing steps to
    create initial segmentations, post-processing steps to refine the neural network
    segmentations, or used in multi-step models consisting of various models along
    a specific pipeline.'

    shape to more implicit approaches where networks are trained in an end-to-end
    way.Up and coming Works propose more intelligent loss functions that no longer
    require additional explicit shape modelling, but only consist of a single neural
    network. Zhang et al. ([2020a](#bib.bib113)) proposed a new geometric loss for
    lesion segmentation. Other examples are Mohagheghi and Foruzan ([2020](#bib.bib77))
    and Han et al. ([2020](#bib.bib39)) where the loss contains shape priors. Li et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib59)) introduces a spatially encoded loss with a special shape
    attention mechanism. Clough et al. ([2019b](#bib.bib20)) uses a topology based
    loss function.

    models to introduce shape knowledge. This combination often stems from a rather
    principled engineering design choice (as shown in Figure [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1
    ‣ 1.1 Yet another review paper ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ A survey on shape-constraint
    deep learning for medical image segmentation")) which is not detailed in any of
    the previous review articles. This review focuses on this overarching design principle
    of shape constraint which, along with being a quick access guide to explicit approaches,
    will work as a research catalyzer of implicit constraints.

- en: Markov Random Fields (MRF) Li ([1994](#bib.bib60)) belong to the domain of graphical
    models and model relationships between pixels or high-level features with a neighborhood
    system. The label probability of a single pixel is thereby conditioned on all
    neighboring pixels which allow to model contextual constraints. The maximum a
    posteriori probability (MAP) can then be calculated by applying the Bayes rule.
    Conditional Random Fields (CRF) Lafferty et al. ([2001](#bib.bib56)) are an extension
    of MRFs and allow to incorporate arbitrary global features over regions of pixels.
    For medical image segmentation this means that they generate smooth edges by using
    this global knowledge about surrounding regions which is a reason why the are
    often applied alongside neural networks to perform medical image segmentation.

- en: The largest category of methods that utilize CRFs or MRFs apply them as a pos-tprocessing
    step. A large portion of papers focus on the straight-forward approach where the
    CNN generates initial segmentations maps which are directly passed to a CRF or
    MRF model as inputs for further refinements. These approaches are evaluated on
    a variety of anatomies and mostly differ in the utilized network architectures
    but follow the same idea. They are applied to lung nodules (Yaguchi et al. ([2019](#bib.bib110)),
    Gao et al. ([2016](#bib.bib36))), retinal vessel (Fu et al. ([2016b](#bib.bib34))),
    brain tumor (Zhao et al. ([2016](#bib.bib118)), Li et al. ([2017a](#bib.bib62))),
    cervical nuclei (Liu et al. ([2018](#bib.bib66))), eye sclera (Mesbah et al. ([2017](#bib.bib75))),
    melanoma (Luo and Yang ([2018](#bib.bib67))), ocular structure (Nguyen et al.
    ([2018](#bib.bib79))), left atrial appendage (Jin et al. ([2018](#bib.bib48))),
    lymph node (Nogues et al. ([2016](#bib.bib81))), liver (Dou et al. ([2016](#bib.bib24)))
    and prostate cancer lesion (Cao et al. ([2019](#bib.bib11))) segmentation tasks.
    A slightly different approach for skin lesion detection by Qiu et al. ([2020](#bib.bib87))
    is based on the same idea, but uses not just a single CNN network, but an ensemble
    of seven or fifteen which are combined inside the CRF. Two other approaches to
    highlight here for brain region (Zhai and Li ([2019](#bib.bib112))) and optical
    discs in fundus image (Bhatkalkar et al. ([2020](#bib.bib7))) segmentation integrate
    a special attention mechanism into their networks with the motivation to improve
    the segmentations by detecting and exploiting salient deep features. Another special
    version that operates on weakly segmented bounding box images for fetal brain
    & lung segmentation is introduced by Rajchl et al. ([2017](#bib.bib88)). Given
    the initial weak segmentations, the model iteratively optimizes the pixel predictions
    with a CNN followed by a CRF to obtain the final segmentation maps.

    homogenity on the outputs of a CNN for subcortical region segmentation. MRFs are
    also utilized in the approach shown by Xia et al. ([2019](#bib.bib105)) for kidney
    segmentation where the MRF is integrated into a SIFT-Flow model.

- en: Besides these classical approaches, another method that came up focused on cascading
    CNN networks that generate segmentations in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Wachinger
    et al. ([2018](#bib.bib103)) use this strategy with a first network that segments
    fore- from background pixels in brain MRIs and a second one that classifies the
    actual brain regions. The same method is also used by Shen and Zhang ([2017](#bib.bib97))
    for brain tumor segmentation, by Dou et al. ([2017](#bib.bib25)) for liver and
    whole heart segmentation, and by Christ et al. ([2016](#bib.bib17)) for liver-based
    lesion segmentation.

- en: A somewhat different cascading structure, for brain tumor segmentation, is introduced
    by Hu et al. ([2019](#bib.bib46)) where multiple subsequent CNNs are used to extract
    more discriminative multi-scale features and to capture dependencies. Feng et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib32)) extend this version on the task of brain tumor segmentation
    with the introduction of residual connections that improve the overall performance.
    Similar to the cascading methods, there are CNNs with two pathways that combine
    two parallel networks on different resolution levels that aim for capturing larger
    3D contexts. The approach was originally introduced by Alansary et al. ([2016](#bib.bib2))
    for placenta segmentation, but was also applied in Cai et al. ([2017](#bib.bib10))
    to the task of pancreas segmentation. Kamnitsas et al. ([2017](#bib.bib50)) proposes
    another related approach where two parallel networks, a FCN that extracts a rough
    mask and a HED that outputs a contour, are fused inside a CRF. In the approach
    by Shen et al. ([2018](#bib.bib96)) that deals with brain tumor segmentation,
    a third path is added where in total three concurrent FCNs are trained based on
    different filtered (gaussian, mean, median) input images. After each network an
    individual CRF is applied and their results are fused in a linear regression model.

- en: The idea of integrating CRF models directly into neural networks origins from
    the task of semantic image segmentation and was introduced by Zheng et al. ([2015](#bib.bib120)).
    They combine the strengths of both models into a unified framework that allows
    end-to-end training. Broken down, the basic task of CRFs is to minimize an energy
    term with an iterative mean field approximation. Since CRFs are graphical models,
    each iteration step can be formulated as a stack of CNN layers. Multiple iterations
    can then be implemented by repeatedly executing this stack or alternatively as
    an equivalent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The resulting network is denoted
    as a CRF-RNN and can be applied on top of any CNN architecture. Fu et al. ([2016a](#bib.bib33))
    are the first to transfer this method to medical image segmentations with a model
    called DeepVessel for the task of retinal vessel segmentation. For the same task
    Luo et al. ([2017](#bib.bib68)) achieve similar results by using a slightly deeper
    base CNN network with more convolution layers. Besides retinal vessel, CRF-RNN
    approaches are applied to a variety of other anatomical structures. Zhao et al.
    ([2016](#bib.bib118)) applies them to brain tumor segmentation and extend it with
    some additional pre- and post-processing steps later on Zhao et al. ([2018b](#bib.bib119)).
    Xu et al. ([2018](#bib.bib109)) uses a V-Net combined with CRF-RNN for bladder
    segmentation and in Monteiro et al. ([2018](#bib.bib78)) they are also applied
    on brain tumor as well as prostate segmentation with 3D multi-modal images. Analogues
    Chen and de Bruijne ([2018](#bib.bib15)) utilizes a U-Net as their base-network
    to deal with white matter lesion segmentation. On the same idea as CRF-RNN Deng
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib23)) uses a CRF-Recurrent Regression based Neural Network
    (CRF-RRNN) integrated with a heterogeneous CNN for brain tumor segmentation where
    the combined network can also be trained end-to-end. Instead of using a full RNN,
    Zhang et al. ([2020d](#bib.bib116)) propose a method where MRF is integrated into
    the segmentation network as a block of local and global convolution layers that
    take the CNN output as unary potentials to calculate the corresponding pairwise
    potentials.

- en: The second category of model assumptions often combined with CNNs are active
    shape models (ASM) Cootes et al. ([1995](#bib.bib21)) or probabilistic active
    shape models (PASM). ASMs require a training set with a fixed number of manually
    annotated landmark points of the segmented object. Each point represents a particular
    part of the object and has to be in the same position over all images. These annotated
    shapes are then iteratively matched and a mean shape is derived. The landmark
    points show different variabilities that are modeled by a Point Distribution Model
    (PDM). Performing a principal component analysis (PCA) and weighting the eigenvectors
    allows creating new shapes in the allowed variability range. For detecting an
    object in an unknown image an algorithm is used that updates pose and shape parameters
    iteratively to improve the match until convergence. An extension to this approach
    are probabilistic ASMs (PASM) Wimmer et al. ([2009](#bib.bib104)). They impose
    a weaker constraint on shapes which allows more flexible contours with more variations
    from the mean shape. This is achieved by introducing a probabilistic energy function
    which is minimized in order to fit a shape to a given image. The model’s ability
    to generalize is thereby improved and the segmentation results outperform standard
    ASMs.

- en: Though CNN based segmentation models yield good segmentation results, they tend
    to produce anatomically implausible segmentation maps that can contain detached
    islands or holes at parts where they do not occur in reality. Since shape models
    represent valid and anatomically plausible shapes, it makes sense to apply them
    in post-processing steps to regularize initial CNN segmentations and transform
    them into a valid shape domain. Xing et al. ([2016](#bib.bib107)) take up this
    idea and apply it to nucleus segmentation. The initial segmentations are generated
    by a CNN and the post-processing step includes a sparse selection-based shape
    model for top-down shape inference, which is more insensitive to object occlusions
    compared to PCA-based shape models, and an additional deformable model for bottom-up
    shape deformation. Also Hsu ([2019](#bib.bib45)) follows this strategy for segmentation
    and tracking of the left ventricle. They swap out the CNN for a Faster-RCNN and
    use an improved ASM that allows to obtain matching points in greater ranges. Fauser
    et al. ([2019](#bib.bib31)) continue on improving the ASM by using a probabilistic
    ASM that is more flexible and allows leaving the shape space. The segmentation
    of the left ventricle is performed by combining the results of three CNN-PASM
    models for each dimension. Another modified ASM is proposed by Medley et al. ([2020](#bib.bib74)).
    The authors use Expectation-Maximization to deal with outliers during optimizing
    the ASM. They also evaluate different ASM features and conclude that a CNN that
    learns the input feature maps for the EM-ASM performs best. Besides improving
    on the ASM a different approach by Karimi et al. ([2019](#bib.bib52)) aims for
    generating better predictions with an ensemble of U-Net like CNN models with different
    filters and parameters. In their approach a SSM model, based on the thresholded
    segmentations from all individual models, is only applied if the disagreement
    between the ensemble models becomes to high. Instead of using the CNN for generating
    segmentation maps, it is also sufficient to only predict bounding boxes as initializations
    for ASMs. Such an approach is applied by Tabrizi et al. ([2018](#bib.bib98)) on
    kidney segmentation where a fuzzy-ASM produces the final segmentations. Li et al.
    ([2018](#bib.bib61)) also uses a CNN for bounding box prediction, but adds an
    intermediate step before utilizing a statistical shape model for myocardial segmentation,
    in which a random forest classifier builds probability maps from the given bounding
    boxes. Another tree model, more specific an adaptive feature learning probability
    boosting tree (AFL-PBT) is also utilized by He et al. ([2018](#bib.bib41)) as
    an initial step to classify voxels for prostate segmentation. A subsequent CNN
    then extracts boundary probability maps and a three-level ASM is employed to generate
    final segmentations.

- en: In this second paragraph we present some papers where the shape models are applied
    pre-hoc before any deep learning network. Two straight forward models for this
    category are proposed by Cheng et al. ([2016](#bib.bib16)) and Fan et al. ([2020](#bib.bib29)).
    In Fan et al. ([2020](#bib.bib29)) a 3D U-Net-like CNN segments Itra-Cholear anatomy
    based on initial segmentations from an ASM and the original CT images. Cheng et al.
    ([2016](#bib.bib16)) on the other hand use a CNN for refining initial segmentations
    from an Active Appearance Model (AAM) that produces only coarse prostate segmentations.
    The AAM is basically an extended shape model that adds an additional texture model
    for better fitting capabilities. The other two models already introduce some pipeline-like
    approaches, but use both a shape model as prior knowledge. The pipeline for subcortical
    region segmentation in Duy et al. ([2018](#bib.bib26)) starts with a pre-processing
    SVM that classifies sagittal slices into groups of similar shape. The prior ASM
    then creates rough segmentations for each group which are finalized by a CNN.
    Further the authors propose an optional CRF model for post-processing. Nguyen
    et al. ([2019](#bib.bib80)) introduce the ASM as a more traditional prior for
    uveal melanoma segmentation where it is used as a constraining term for a CRF
    model that is based on Grad-CAM (class activation maps) heatmaps. The final segmentations
    are again generated with a U-Net that combines the CRF with original input CTs.

- en: The last category for combining shape models and neural networks contains all
    approaches that consist of different models arranged along pipelines. The motivation
    is to process input images stage-wise or in a coarse-to-fine way that allows to
    capture more information and hence result in more accurate segmentation maps.
    In the models by Tack et al. ([2018](#bib.bib99)) for knee menisci, Ambellan et al.
    ([2019](#bib.bib3)) for knee bone & cartilage, and Brusini et al. ([2020](#bib.bib8))
    for hippocampus segmentation, the pipelines combine multiple CNNs and SSMs. All
    three start with initial 2D U-Nets regularized by SSMs which are used to extract
    smaller 3D subvolumes. Tack et al. ([2018](#bib.bib99)) and Ambellan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib3))
    apply an additional 3D U-Net afterwards, whereas Brusini et al. ([2020](#bib.bib8))
    uses three U-Nets and averages their predictions to obtain final segmentations.
    Ambellan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib3)) further continues after this step and utilizes
    a second 3D SSM model to obtain the knee bone segmentations and even applies a
    third U-Net to segment the cartilage afterwards. Besides these typical pipelines,
    there are also some hybrid approaches we count to this category that integrate
    shape models and neural networks. They use special CNNs that directly predicts
    the parameters of an SSM, which are the shape coefficients (weights for the modes
    of variations), the pose parameters. Qin et al. ([2020](#bib.bib86)) use such
    a SSM-Net inside a small pipeline for prostate segmentation. They propose an inception-based
    network that directly predicts parameters of the SSM which can be back-translated
    into a prostate contour prediction. Parallel to this, a residual U-Net generates
    probability maps from the inputs. The final segmentations are generated by averaging
    the outputs of both models. The method of Tilborghs et al. ([2020](#bib.bib102))
    for left ventricle segmentation is based on the same idea, but removes the small
    pipeline. Instead they modify the CNN and add a third output which is an actual
    distance map. A special loss function is used to train the network toward optimizing
    the segmentation map alongside the SSM parameters. A nearly identical approach
    by Karimi et al. ([2018](#bib.bib51)) is applied to prostate segmentation. Their
    CNN predicts center position of the prostate, the shape model parameters, and
    a rotation vector which are passed to a final layer that outputs the coordinates
    of the landmark points which resemble the a final segmentation map. Schock et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib94)) relies on the same method for knee bone & cartilage segmentation,
    but extend it with additional pre- and post-processing steps. They add a preprocessing
    2D U-Net that detects initial bone positions and crop the volume into subvolumes
    which only contain the femur or tibia bone. Afterwards their SSM-Net comes into
    place that predicts the SSM parameters and the actual landmarks in a subsequent
    PCA layer. An additional fine-tuning step then generates the cartilage segmentations
    with a 3D U-Net based on subvolumes centered at the bones’ landmark points. Rather
    than integrating the SSM and CNN, Ma et al. ([2018](#bib.bib69)) introduces a
    Bayesian model that integrates both, the CNN and a robust kernel SSM (RKSSM) for
    the task of pancreas segmentation. At first the RKSSM is initialized to fit the
    detected ROI of a Dense U-Net. A Gaussian Mixture Model afterwards guides the
    shape adaption and iteratively projects the adapted shape onto the RKSSM until
    convergence which results in the final segmentation map.

- en: A last type of models that often combined with deep learning models to incorporate
    shape knowledge are Active Contour Models (ACM) Kass et al. ([1988](#bib.bib54))
    , also known as snakes. A snake is a deformable controlled continuity spline that
    is pushed towards edges or contours by minimizing an energy function under the
    influence of different forces and constraints. It consists of an internal energy
    that keeps the contour continuous and smooth, an image energy that attracts it
    to contours, and an external constraint force that adds user-imposed guidance.
    A similar approach are level set functions (LSF) introduced by Andrew ([2000](#bib.bib4))
    and firstly applied to image segmentation by Malladi et al. ([1995](#bib.bib72)).
    An LSF is a higher dimensional function where a contour is defined as its zero
    level set. With a speed function, derived from the image, that controls the evolution
    of the surface over time, a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation can
    be obtained.

    to apply them as a post-processing step to improve an initial segmentation map.
    An early model by Middleton and Damper ([2004](#bib.bib76)) uses only a simple
    multilayer perceptron (MLP) that creates binary pixel-wise boundary predictions
    for lung segmentation. Since these are very rough and contain misclassifications
    the ASM is used to improve and close the contour. Salimi et al. ([2018](#bib.bib93))
    is also based on an MLP, but adds an vector field convolution to the ACM to make
    it more robust for prostate segmentation
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the more recent ACM post-processing models are exclusively based on
    different CNN architectures and are applied to a variety of anatomies. Li et al.
    ([2017b](#bib.bib63)) use a FCN that is refined by a classic ACM for left ventricle
    segmentation. The same approach is taken by Guo et al. ([2019](#bib.bib38)) for
    liver segmentation and Zhao et al. ([2018a](#bib.bib117)) utilize it for nucleus
    segmentation. In the approaches by Xu et al. ([2019](#bib.bib108)) the ACM refinements
    are not yet the final steps and additional adaptive ellipse fitting is used to
    segment breast nuclei. Hu et al. ([2018](#bib.bib47)) and Fang et al. ([2019](#bib.bib30))
    transfer the basic refinement method to breast tumor detection with a phase-based
    ACM that improves over multiple iterations. A different slightly modified ACM
    post-processing method is based on geodesic computations and is further used by
    Ma and Yang ([2019](#bib.bib70)) for dental root segmentation and Nunes et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib83)) for lung segmentation. Zhang et al. ([2020b](#bib.bib114))
    also introduces a special ACM that integrates a fourth-order partial differential
    equation and segments plaque based on an initial R-CNN segmentation. Instead of
    just refining an initial CNN predicted per-pixel segmentation map, da Silva et al.
    ([2020](#bib.bib22)) use a Chan-Vese ACM to generate prostate segmentation on
    DCNN coarsely classified superpixels which only represent rough initialization
    for the contour model. The authors of Kot et al. ([2020](#bib.bib55)) further
    separate the two models where the CNN masks bone tissue which is removed for the
    ACM to segment brain tumors. The last special approach in the ACM category by
    Zhang et al. ([2020c](#bib.bib115)) is a hybrid model that integrates an ACM into
    a U-Net. The resulting deep active contour network (DACN) is end-to-end trainable
    with a special ACM based loss function and automatically segments cervical cells
    and skin lesions. Besides ACM, another large number of approaches rely on level
    set functions (LSF). Same as before a CNN is used for generating initial segmentation
    maps which are then refined by the LSF. Hatamizadeh et al. ([2019](#bib.bib40))
    uses this for brain, liver, lung segmentation, Gong et al. ([2019](#bib.bib37))
    for pancreas segmentation, Carbajal-Degante et al. ([2020](#bib.bib12)) for ventricle
    and liver segmentation, and Xie et al. ([2020](#bib.bib106)) for left ventricle
    segmentation. Some extra processing is made in Yang et al. ([2021](#bib.bib111))
    for dental pulp segmentation where the initial CNN segmentations are used to calculate
    elliptic curves which are used to guide the LSF. In general, for the LSF it is
    often sufficient to initialize them only with a rough bounding boxes or region
    of interest annotations. So, Liu et al. ([2019](#bib.bib65)) use a Faster RCNN
    to generate location boxes of left atriums which serve as input for the LSF after
    Otsu thresholding. Avendi et al. ([2016](#bib.bib6)) inserts an additional step
    between CNN ROI detection and LSF segmentation where the initial left-ventricle
    shape is inferred with an stacked auto-encoder. In comparison to these two approaches,
    in Cha et al. ([2016](#bib.bib13)) the CNN is not used to predict ROI, but to
    classify if an ROI is part of the bladder. The outputs are then refined by three
    different 3D LSF and a final 2D LSF afterwards. Another idea is to use recurrent
    pipelines where the segmentations are refined iteratively. Such an approach is
    introduced by Tang et al. ([2017](#bib.bib101)) where both models are integrated
    into a FCN-LSF. The method is used for left ventricle and liver segmentation with
    semi-supervised training where the LSF gradually refines the segmentation and
    backpropagates a loss to improve the FCN. Hoogi et al. ([2017](#bib.bib44)) proposed
    a different iterative process. Hereby the CNN estimates if the zero level set
    is inside, outside or near the lesion boundary. Based on these the LSF parameters
    are calculated and the contour is evolved. The process then repeats until convergence.

    uses an ACM to remove skull tissue from images and applies a simple artificial
    neural network to classify the remaining brain regions. Rupprecht et al. ([2016](#bib.bib92))
    introduce an approach where the ACM is guided by the CNN. The ACM generated rough
    segmentations of the left ventricle. A CNN then predicts vectors on patches around
    each pixel of this initial contour that point towards closes object boundary points
    and are used to further evolve the contour. The latest method for this category
    by Kasinathan et al. ([2019](#bib.bib53)) also uses the ACM to generate initial
    segmentations, more specific it segments all lung nodules. A post-processing CNN
    afterwards classifies them or removes false positives.

- en: An alternative approach to integrating shape priors into network-based segmentation
    was presented in Lee et al. ([2019](#bib.bib57)). Here, the segmentation started
    with a candidate shape which was topologically correct (and approximately correct
    in terms of its shape), and the network was trained to provide the appropriate
    deformation to this shape such that it maximally overlapped with the ground truth
    segmentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such methods can be considered to have a ‘hard prior’ rather than the ‘soft-prior’
    of the methods presented above in the sense that the end result can be guaranteed
    to have the correct shape. However, this approach may be limited by a requirement
    that the initial candidate shape be very close to an acceptable answer such that
    only small shape deformations are needed. A further potential issue is that the
    deformation field provided by the network may need to be restricted to prevent
    the shape from overlapping itself and consequently changing its topology.

- en: The differentiable properties of persistent homology Edelsbrunner et al. ([2000](#bib.bib27))
    make it a promising candidate for the integration of topological information into
    the training of neural networks. The key idea is that it measures the presence
    of topological features as some threshold or length scale changes. Persistent
    features are those which exist for a wide range of filtration values, and this
    persistence is differentiable with respect to the original data. There have recently
    been a number of approaches suggested for the integration of PH and deep learning,
    which we briefly review here.

- en: In Chen et al. ([2018](#bib.bib14)) a classification task was considered, and
    PH was used to regularise the decision boundary. Typical regularisation of a decision
    boundary might encourage it to be smooth or to be far from the data. Here, the
    boundary was encouraged to be simple from a topological point of view, meaning
    that topological complexities such as loops and handles in the decision boundary
    were discouraged. Rieck et al. ([2018](#bib.bib90)) proposed a measure of the
    complexity of a neural network using PH. This measure of ‘neural persistence’
    was evaluated as a measure of structural complexity at each layer of the network,
    and was shown to increase during network training as well as being useful as a
    stopping criterion.

- en: PH is applied to image segmentation, but the PH calculation has typically been
    applied to the input image and used as a way to generate features which can then
    be used by another algorithm. Applications have included tumour segmentation Qaiser
    et al. ([2016](#bib.bib85)), cell segmentation Assaf et al. ([2017](#bib.bib5))
    and cardiac segmentation from computed tomography (CT) imaging Gao et al. ([2013](#bib.bib35)).
    Recently Clough et al. ([2019a](#bib.bib19)) proposed to use PH not to the input
    image being segmented, but rather to the candidate segmentation provided by the
    network. In an extended work Clough et al. Clough et al. ([2020](#bib.bib18))
    the topological information found by the PH calculation can be used to provide
    a training signal to the network, allowing an differentiable loss function to
    compare the topological features present in a proposed segmentation, with those
    specified to exist by some prior knowledge.

    setting towards more systematic end-to-end training approaches. This effect is
    depicted in Figure [4](#S6.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 6.1 End-to-End vs post/pre-hoc ‣ 6 Discussion
    ‣ A survey on shape-constraint deep learning for medical image segmentation")
    where the paper counts are aggregated from this work and Jurdi et al. ([2020](#bib.bib49)).
    The maturity of deep learning frameworks (especially PyTorch), novel architectures
    (especially generative modeling) and automatic differentiation make it possible
    to incorporate complex shape-based loss functions during training. With the availability
    of these tools, large models can be trained with tailored shape streams in the
    model architecture to incorporate shape information.

- en: The ability to incorporate additional information using shape as a prior can
    aid in reducing the total number of necessary annotations in achieving a good
    segmentation. The shape priors can useful in generating controlled data augmentations
    for the medical image analysis task in hand and reduce the number of unrealistic
    augmentations. This would be instrumental in particular in the case of rare diseases,
    where there is not enough of data and manual annotations to train a neural network.
    The shape priors that are giving clues about the expected pathology in such cases
    can lead to better segmentation accuracy in the final output.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common theme identified by last few decades worth research on shape modeling
    is the difficulty in representing the pathological shapes. While the "typical
    shapes" i.e. normal shapes lie in a low-dimensional sub-manifold, the pathological
    cases have a long tail in the distribution (e.g. congenital heart diseases). That
    is normal shapes are self-similar but pathological cases contain atypical shapes
    along with typical pathologies. Traditional linearized shape modeling had trouble
    addressing this issue whereas the non-linear modeling of shape statistics had
    its issue in terms of intractable numerics. Whether a neural approach can address
    this overarching problem of encoding pathological shapes is an open problem. Unfortunately,
    from our literature search, we have not found any clear direction to address this
    perennial issue of shape modeling.

- en: While the shape constraints are becoming increasingly commonplace for medical
    image segmentation, we believe the visual perception and human comprehension plays
    a significant role behind the interest of the community. The more general question
    of real world effectiveness of these methods are not often studied. For example,
    how effective these shape constraints are under noisy annotation is an open question?
    While the segmentation quality is most often measured by the Dice metric, Maier-Hein
    et al. ([2018](#bib.bib71)) has already prescribed to move beyond Dice to evaluate
    the segmentation quality. Topological accuracy of anatomical structures is increasingly
    used as an evaluation metric to address the shortcomings of classical image segmentation
    evaluation metric in medical image analysis Byrne et al. ([2020](#bib.bib9)).
    Finally, segmentation is typically a mean to an end. As such, the effectiveness
    of these segmentation techniques should be measured quantitatively for downstream
    evaluation tasks such as visualization, planning Fauser et al. ([2019](#bib.bib31))
    etc.

- en: Bringing prior knowledge about the shape of the anatomy for semantic segmentation
    is a rather well-trodden idea. The community is devising new ways to incorporate
    such prior knowledge in deep learning models trained with frequentist approach.
    While the Bayesian interpretation of deep learning segmentation networks is an
    upcoming trend, it is already shown that under careful considerations, prior knowledge
    about the shape can be incorporated even in frequentist approaches with significant
    success.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We believe the community needs to address the issues discussed in Section [6](#S6
    "6 Discussion ‣ A survey on shape-constraint deep learning for medical image segmentation")
    before shape constrained segmentation can be considered as a trustworthy technology
    in practical medical image analysis. To this end, we can think of shape constrained
    segmentation as a technical building block within a bigger image analysis pipeline
    rather than a stand-alone piece of technology. For example, in the case of surgical
    planning and navigation pipeline, such shape constraints can be meaningful provided
    the performance is thoroughly validated under pathological cases with multiple
    quality metrics. Important steps have already been taken in this direction. In
    short, along with exciting results, shape constrained deep learning for segmentation
    opens up many possible research questions for the next few years. Proper understanding
    and answering those hold the key to their successful deployment in the real clinical
    scenario.
