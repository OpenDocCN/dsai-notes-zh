- en: Context. We have developed deep learning (DL) and AI based tools to search extant
    narrow-band wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys of the Galactic Plane for elusive planetary
    nebulae (PNe) which are hidden in dense star fields towards the Galactic centre.
    They are faint, low-surface brightness, usually resolved sources, which are not
    discovered by previous automatic searches that depend on photometric data for
    point-like sources. These sources are very challenging to find by traditional
    visual inspection in such crowded fields and many have been missed. We have successfully
    adopted a novel ’Swin-Transformer’ AI algorithm, which we described in detail
    in the preceding Techniques paper (Paper I).

    searching.

    likely and possible PNe (70.97%), 3 emission-line galaxies, 2 emission-line stars,
    2 late-type star contaminants and 2 other H$\alpha$ sources including a newly
    identified detached fragment of SNR RCW 84\. We present the imaging and spectral
    data of these candidates and a preliminary analysis of their properties. These
    data provide strong input to help to evaluate and refine the behaviour of the
    AI algorithm when searching for PNe in wide-field H$\alpha$ surveys.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A planetary nebula (PN) is a brief but crucial stage in the late stage evolution
    of low- to intermediate-mass stars. Their properties can reveal the physics of
    stellar nucleosynthesis and mass loss processes occurring during this phase, e.g.
    Iben ([1995](#bib.bib13)), Galactic chemical enrichment and any Galactic abundance
    gradients, see Maciel et al. ([2003](#bib.bib11)); Henry et al. ([2010](#bib.bib10));
    Maciel et al. ([2015](#bib.bib24)); Stanghellini & Haywood ([2018](#bib.bib16)).
    As one of the most complex and beautiful astrophysical object classes to study,
    a PN is the final, ejected gaseous envelope from its central star (CSPN) after
    the asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase. These envelopes are ionized by the
    high-energy radiation emitted by the CSPN as it evolves towards becoming a white
    dwarf (WD). They experience dramatic evolution over cosmological short periods
    of time from typically $\sim 21,000\pm 5,000$ years (Jacob et al., [2013](#bib.bib15);
    Badenes et al., [2015](#bib.bib17)), although an even older example of a PN in
    an open cluster is estimated at an age of $\sim 50,000$ years (Fragkou et al.,
    [2022](#bib.bib23)). This brevity makes them rare. They exhibit a diverse range
    of properties, including morphology, size, surface brightness distribution, ionization
    characteristics, elemental abundances, densities and expansion rates related to
    the mass, temperature and properties of the CSPN. PNe can be easily confused with
    other objects, such as H II regions, young stellar objects (YSOs), supernova remnants
    (SNRs), Wolf-Rayet shells, nova shells, stellar-ejecta and symbiotic systems as
    described in (Frew & Parker, [2010](#bib.bib8)) and (Parker, [2022](#bib.bib18)).
    Such shared characteristics among various types of nebulae can cause difficulties
    in hunting for them with automatic software which generally performs better on
    more regular targets like stars and galaxies. With the advent of deep, wide-field,
    H$\alpha$ surveys of the Galactic plane in the past 20 years, such as the SHS
    (Parker et al., [2005](#bib.bib5)) in the South and IPHAS (Drew et al., [2005](#bib.bib4))
    in North, a remarkable contribution of  50% to the $\sim 3800$ currently known
    Galactic PNe (Parker et al., [2016](#bib.bib12)) was made by visual examination
    from H$\alpha$ narrow-band images contrasted with corresponding red broad-band
    images in a major series of papers led by and involving the second author (Parker
    et al., [2006](#bib.bib6); Miszalski et al., [2008](#bib.bib9); Sabin et al.,
    [2014](#bib.bib14)).

    of the Southern Galactic plane, using the VST telescope in Chile, finished 91.6%
    of its planned footprint up to August 2018 with a coverage of $\sim 2000$ sq.deg.
    So far it has not been effectively scanned by human eyes. In the Galactic bulge
    the survey was extended from its standard $\pm 5$ degrees Galactic latitude covered
    to $\rm|b|=10^{\circ}$. The survey has an angular resolution of $\sim 0.21$ arcsec/pixel
    well matched to the natural seeing that often approaches 0.5 arcsec. This higher
    resolution Southern survey, which includes the rich Galactic bulge region, provides
    a great opportunity to hunt for small resolved PNe hidden behind the dense star
    field towards the Galactic centre. To utilize the data in a more efficient, objective
    and consistent way, we constructed a deep learning object detection algorithm
    for PNe based on the novel Swin-Transformer model (Liu et al., [2021](#bib.bib3)).
    For details see Sun et al. ([2024](#bib.bib26)). This data-driven method was adjusted
    according to the diverse properties of PNe, trained with 1137 individual images
    from IPHAS and corresponding catalogue from HASH database ¹¹1HASH: online at http://www.hashpn.space.
    HASH federates available multi- wavelength imaging, spectroscopic and other data
    for all known Galactic and Magellanic Cloud PNe. (Parker et al., [2016](#bib.bib12);
    Parker, [2022](#bib.bib18)), and then validated with a further 454 PNe images.
    The validation results are the successful detection of 97.8% of all known PNe.
    Of the detected targets 96.5% are real in HASH, which showed very decent performance
    for our model. Previous machine learning and deep learning work in PNe research,
    Faundez-Abans et al. ([1996](#bib.bib25)) used hierarchical cluster analysis and
    supervised ANN (artificial neural network) to classify PNe according to their
    chemical composition (so based on spectroscopy), while Akras et al. ([2019](#bib.bib19))
    used a decision tree model to find compact PNe in infrared photometric data. Most
    recently Awang Iskandar et al. ([2020](#bib.bib22)) applied multiple DNN (deep
    neural network) models to several infrared and optical image datasets to distinguish
    PNe from all the types of non-PNe, and classify their morphologies with some success.'

    Our observations were performed between Jun 13^(th)-21^(st), 2023, on the 1.9m
    SAAO telescope using the SpUpNIC spectrograph (Crause et al., [2016](#bib.bib21))
    under the RUN #484\. We used grating gr7 (300 lines per mm, blaze of 4600 Å, range
    of 5550 Å, dispersion of 2.72 Å/pixel), and typically used a slit width 17 ($\sim$2
    arcseconds). We adjusted exposure times according to the brightness of the targets,
    typically 300s for brighter, more compact PNe, 600s for intermediate surface brightness
    candidates and 900s for our fainter targets including some repeated 900s for such
    very faint ones. For the specific target YP0900-4457 (see later), we observed

    We created master bias with zerocombine task, and then smoothed it with imsurfit
    task. For dome and sky flats, the master flats were created with the flatcombine
    task. The master dome flat was fitted with the response task, then the new sky
    flat was generated by the ccdproc task, finally the residual slope was removed
    with illum task from the new sky flat, and a ’perfect flat’ was created by the
    imarith task, multiplying the fitted master dome flat by the final new sky flat.
    We can then correct for both bias and flat and then trim the spectra with the
    ccdproc task on the spectra of all object, ARC and flux calibrator spectra.

    The 1-D spectra of targets and ARCs were then extracted from the 2-D spectra using
    the apall task after identifying the nebula region and sky regions (for sky subtraction).
    The Wavelength calibration was conducted with the identify, reidentify, refspec
    and dispcor tasks, to determinate the dispersion solutions from the ARC calibration
    spectra taken for each target observation and assigned to the target spectra as
    appropriate. Finally, flux calibration was conducted with the standard, sensfunc
    and calibrate tasks, for our targets using selected standard stars LTT4364 and
    LTT9239 observed during each night.

    assessing key features, following the precepts summarised in Parker ([2022](#bib.bib18))
    - refer Figure 11 and Section 12.2 of that paper. This includes whether the target
    appears as an emission object in narrow-band imaging (our ML/AI algorithm detects
    as many unknown emission objects as possible), whether the target exhibits conforms
    to typical PN morphological classifications. We adopt the HASH ERBIAS/sparm morphological
    classification scheme (Parker et al., [2006](#bib.bib6)). We also assess whether
    nebula emission lines of reasonable S/N in the candidate follow-up spectra align
    with characteristics specific of typical PN types and evolutionary stages. However,
    typical emission line ratios of certain nebulae can still be mistaken for PNe.
    It may sometimes be necessary to consider the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$
    line for making judgments (Stasińska et al., [2022](#bib.bib27)). In the subsequent
    subsections, we will provide examples of how to determine the type of target in
    specific cases.

    spectroscopically confirmed 16 true, 2 likely and 4 possible PNe. We further identified
    3 emission-line galaxies (here their redshifts are low enough that the [N II]
    and H-alpha lines were not shifted out of the VPHAS+ H$\alpha$ narrow-band filter),
    2 emission-line stars, 2 late-type stars, 1 possible SNR fragment and 1 known
    emission blob in a star cluster. It is clear that all but the two late-type stars
    had real emission lines. The properties of these candidates are summarised in
    Table [1](#S2.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 2 Spectrum Observation and Reduction ‣ First Discovery

    to VPHAS+ Survey Data"), including common names, RA (J2000) & Dec (J2000), Galactic

    Note that the diameters of candidates were measured with the DS9 region function
    on VPHAS+ H$\alpha$ images whose scale is zscale. We provided examples for each

    here the spectroscopic confirmation is vital and based on the nature of the target’s

    apparently unresolved sources for observation that appeared to have obvious H$\alpha$
    emission given the disparity in intensity between the H$\alpha$ image and the
    broad-band red equivalent. These were suspected of being either emission-line
    stars or perhaps late- type star contaminants. This selection was done blindly
    from the AI/ML provided VPHAS+ target lists without reference to other imagery
    (which could have been indicative of likely source type). Spectral analysis of
    these selected cases revealed that two (6.45% of the total) were indeed late-type
    stars dominated by strong molecular bands (see Figure [11](#A0.F11 "Figure 11
    ‣ First Discovery and Confirmation of PN Candidates Found from AI and Deep Learning
    Techniques Applied to VPHAS+ Survey Data")). As described in Parker et al. ([2006](#bib.bib6)),
    these arise because of how the molecular band distribution falls within the H$\alpha$
    filter bandpass while simultaneously increasing in strength of peak intensity
    as one moves further to the red. This gets selected by the H$\alpha$ filter whereas
    the band influence is diluted by their inclusion in the broad-band red-filter.
    The apparent image shape of YP1705-2524 (one of these late type star contaminants)
    is slightly elongated due to the presence of another relatively faint star nearby.
    Two emission line stars (EM stars) were also found, again accounting for 6.45%
    of the total (see Figure [9](#A0.F9 "Figure 9 ‣ First Discovery and Confirmation
    of PN Candidates Found from AI and Deep Learning Techniques Applied to VPHAS+
    Survey Data")). One of the EM stars (YP0900-4457, the third and forth lines of
    Figure [2](#S3.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 3.1 True PNe ‣ 3 Results ‣ First Discovery and Confirmation
    of PN Candidates Found from AI and Deep Learning Techniques Applied to VPHAS+
    Survey Data")) is located in a sparsely populated stellar field region indicating
    a strong absorption screen behind the stars that are visible. The spectrum exhibits
    multiple very strong emission lines with an nebular outflow to the north. A spectrum
    of this outflow was also taken which has a very similar spectrum to that of the
    assumed host star. However, there is another possibility that our spectroscopic
    observation missed the outflow and instead captured the edge of the star, which
    requires further examination. Both emission line stars discovered show Ca II triplet
    lines in the infrared in emission. These results show that selection of these
    types of apparent emitter could provide a rich vein of faint emission lines stars
    for further study - more examples are needed to statistically establish the true
    emission versus late-type star fractions which here are nominally 50% each.

- en: We have presented the first discovery and confirmation of PNe candidates found
    from deep learning techniques applied to high-resolution VPHAS+ survey data. We
    have proven our techniques are able to independently and automatically uncover
    faint, resolved PNe in very dense star fields near the Galactic centre using the
    high-resolution H$\alpha$ survey VPHAS+. These targets are often beyond the reach
    of traditional detection software and often visual scrutiny. Our automated techniques,
    once trained as described in Paper I save the significant manpower required of
    eye-inspection applied to the large imaging survey datasets. To achieve these
    very encouraging results we developed a novel Swin-Transformer algorithm (see
    Sun et al. ([2024](#bib.bib26))) with an IPHAS training sample based on the existing
    inventory of PNe curated within the HASH PNe database (Parker et al., [2016](#bib.bib12)).
    We found more than 800 high-quality candidates and selected 31 of them for initial
    spectral observation at SAAO. We spectroscopically confirmed that 22 are true
    (T), likely (L) and possible (P) PNe giving a formal confirmation level of 70.97%.
    These PNe are mostly very faint and located in dense fields, with several directly
    partially obscured behind stars or under the glow/interference of a very bright
    nearby stars. We also found a CSPN white dwarf with an interesting H$\alpha$ jet.
    Of the remaining 9 sources 7 were emission line sources comprising 3 emission
    line galaxies, 2 emission lines stars, a component of a supernova and an emission
    blob in a star cluster. Only 2/31 objects were non-emitters being classed as late-type
    stars with string red molecular bands. This give an overall success rate for detection
    of emission sources of all kinds at 29/31 or 93.5%.

    stacking them for fainter nebulae, and improved searching techniques based on
    the fusion of all available the wavebands. And a pixel-to-pixel H$\alpha$ nebulae
    map is also planned for a more complete search for faint PNe and other kinds of
    nebulae.
