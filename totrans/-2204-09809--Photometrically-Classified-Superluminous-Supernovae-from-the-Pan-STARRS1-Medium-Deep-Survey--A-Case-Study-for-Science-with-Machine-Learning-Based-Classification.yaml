- en: With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time
    (LSST), it is expected that only $\sim 0.1\%$ of all transients will be classified
    spectroscopically. To conduct studies of rare transients, such as Type I superluminous
    supernovae (SLSNe), we must instead rely on photometric classification. In this
    vein, here we carry out a pilot study of SLSNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep
    Survey (PS1-MDS) classified photometrically with our SuperRAENN and Superphot
    algorithms. We first construct a sub-sample of the photometric sample using a
    list of simple selection metrics designed to minimize contamination and ensure
    sufficient data quality for modeling. We then fit the multi-band light curves
    with a magnetar spin-down model using the Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients
    (MOSFiT). Comparing the magnetar engine and ejecta parameter distributions of
    the photometric sample to those of the PS1-MDS spectroscopic sample and a larger
    literature spectroscopic sample, we find that these samples are overall consistent,
    but that the photometric sample extends to slower spins and lower ejecta masses,
    which correspond to lower luminosity events, as expected for photometric selection.
    While our PS1-MDS photometric sample is still smaller than the overall SLSN spectroscopic
    sample, our methodology paves the way to an orders-of-magnitude increase in the
    SLSN sample in the LSST era through photometric selection and study.

- en: Hydrogen-poor (Type I) superluminous supernovae (hereafter SLSNe) are a rare
    sub-class of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) that radiate $\sim 10-100$ times
    more energy in the UV/optical than typical CCSNe, and generally exhibit longer
    durations and hotter continuum spectra (e.g., Chomiuk et al., [2011](#bib.bib11);
    Quimby et al., [2011](#bib.bib50); Nicholl et al., [2015](#bib.bib41); Inserra
    et al., [2017](#bib.bib26); Lunnan et al., [2018](#bib.bib32); De Cia et al.,
    [2018](#bib.bib13)). SLSNe account for only $\sim 0.1\%$ of the volumetric CCSN
    rate (Quimby et al., [2018](#bib.bib51); Frohmaier et al., [2021](#bib.bib16)),
    but in magnitude-limited optical surveys they account for $\sim 2\%$ of all transients
    (Perley et al., [2020](#bib.bib47); Gomez et al., [2021](#bib.bib18)) thanks to
    their high luminosity. SLSNe are classified spectroscopically based on the lack
    of hydrogen Balmer lines, the presence of a blue continuum, and unique early time
    “W”-shaped O II absorption lines at $\sim 3600-4600$ Å (e.g., Lunnan et al., [2013](#bib.bib30);
    Mazzali et al., [2016](#bib.bib34); Quimby et al., [2018](#bib.bib51); Nicholl,
    [2021](#bib.bib36)).

- en: Several mechanisms have been proposed to power SLSNe, but a magnetar central
    engine model (Kasen & Bildsten, [2010](#bib.bib29); Woosley, [2010](#bib.bib58);
    Dessart et al., [2012](#bib.bib14); Metzger et al., [2015](#bib.bib35); Nicholl
    et al., [2017b](#bib.bib39)) has had the most success in explaining both the light
    curves and spectra of the SLSN population. This model accounts for the broad range
    of peak luminosities and timescales (e.g., Nicholl et al. [2017b](#bib.bib39);
    Blanchard et al. [2020](#bib.bib7)), for the early UV/optical spectra (e.g., Nicholl
    et al. [2017a](#bib.bib38)), for the nebular phase spectra (e.g., Nicholl et al.
    [2016b](#bib.bib43), [2019](#bib.bib37); Jerkstrand et al. [2017](#bib.bib28)),
    and for the power law decline rates observed in SN 2015bn and SN 2016inl at $\gtrsim
    10^{3}$ d (Nicholl et al., [2018](#bib.bib44); Blanchard et al., [2021](#bib.bib6)).
    Additional support for a magnetar engine comes from the low metallicity host galaxies
    of SLSNe, which most closely resemble the hosts of long-duration gamma-ray bursts,
    another rare population of CCSNe that are likely powered by a central engine (Lunnan
    et al., [2014](#bib.bib31); Perley et al., [2016](#bib.bib46)). While the magnetar
    engine model can explain the plethora of SLSN properties, other mechanisms have
    also been proposed to explain some SLSN properties; for example, Chen et al. ([2022](#bib.bib10))
    recently argued that the light curves of at least some SLSNe from the Zwicky Transient
    Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al. [2019](#bib.bib5)) can be explained equally well with
    a combination of circumstellar interaction (CSM) and Ni^(56) decay. Furthermore,
    Hosseinzadeh et al. ([2021](#bib.bib20)) also explored ejecta-CSM interaction
    as a potential source for post-peak undulations in SLSN light curves.

    the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; Ivezić et al.,
    [2019](#bib.bib27)), only a small fraction of SNe are being classified spectroscopically
    ($\sim 10\%$ currently, and $\sim 0.1\%$ anticipated for LSST; Villar et al. [2020](#bib.bib56)).
    This impacts the ability to advance the study of rare SN classes, such as SLSNe,
    in particular. As shown by Villar et al. ([2018](#bib.bib55)), LSST may yield
    $\sim 10^{4}$ SLSNe per year to $z\sim 3$ (of which at least $\sim 20\%$ will
    have well measured physical properties), but identifying these events requires
    photometric classification.

    pipelines, SuperRAENN (Villar et al., [2020](#bib.bib56)) and Superphot (Hosseinzadeh

    Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS; Huber et al., [2017](#bib.bib23)). Both classifiers
    use multiple SN classes, including in particular SLSNe. SuperRAENN combines a
    novel unsupervised recurrent autoencoder neural network (RAENN) with a random
    forest classifier for a semi-supervised algorithm. Superphot utilizes a random
    forest approach based on flexible analytic model fits to the light curves and

    variability over the 4.5 year time-span of the survey could survive this preliminary
    qualitative cut and eventually be classified as SLSNe. In particular, Hosseinzadeh
    et al. ([2020](#bib.bib21)) find that 14 photometrically-classified SLSNe with
    host galaxy spectra that exhibit broad AGN lines are located within $1^{\prime\prime}$

    (Nicholl et al., [2017b](#bib.bib39); Villar et al., [2018](#bib.bib55); Blanchard
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib7)) have already modeled all but one of these events (PS1-12cil)
    in the same manner as this work. Two peculiar events from the PS1-MDS spectroscopically-classified
    sample, PS1-11ap and PS1-12cil, exhibit post-peak undulations (e.g., Inserra et al.,

    Nicholl et al., [2016a](#bib.bib42); Hosseinzadeh et al., [2021](#bib.bib20)).
    Since our MOSFiT model does not account for these “bumps”, we replace the model
    of PS1-11ap from Blanchard et al. ([2020](#bib.bib7)) with the version presented
    in Hosseinzadeh et al. ([2021](#bib.bib20)), which converts these bumps into upper
    limits prior to fitting. We also include the model for PS1-12cil from Hosseinzadeh
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib20)) to complete the PS1-MDS spectroscopic SLSN sample.
    For illustrative purposes, we extrapolate all light curves (both photometric and
    spectroscopic samples) back to the inferred explosion time and forward 100 days
    after the last detection.'

    design characteristics of the various surveys (e.g., PS1-MDS, Dark Energy Survey,
    PTF, etc). In terms of the magnetar model parameters we find that the distributions
    are overall in good agreement, except for the ejecta velocity, which has statistically
    significant $p$-values for the A-D test. This indicates that we can reject the
    null hypothesis at 95% conficence that the ejecta velocity for the photometric
    and the spectroscopic compilation samples are drawn from the same distribution.
    This may be caused by the sensitivity of the A-D test to tail distributions. The
    spectroscopic compilation sample spans a range of $\varv_{\rm ej}\approx(3.6-16)\times
    10^{3}$ km s^(-1), while the photometric sample spans a range of $\varv_{\rm ej}\approx(2.2-14)\times
    10^{3}$ km s^(-1), with two events⁶⁶6The two $\varv_{\rm ej}$ outliers (PSc130096
    and PSc390605) have relatively few data points. PSc130096 lacks a definitive peak
    and any post-peak data, and the model is therefore only marginally constrained.
    PSc390605 similarly lacks pre- and post-peak again leading to a marginally constrained
    model. (PSc130096 and PSc390605) having $\varv_{\rm ej}$ values that fall outside
    the range of the spectroscopic population. Removing these two outliers return
    an updated A-D test $p$-value of $\approx 0.06$, suggesting that other than these
    two specific data points, the remainder of the photometric sample fit into the
    spectroscopic sample well. We explore the posterior distributions of the magnetar
    parameters from the photometric sample in more detail in the next subsection.

- en: In this paper we presented a case study for time-domain science with machine
    learning-based photometric classification, focusing on SLSNe from the PS1-MDS.
    Our analysis consisted of two critical aspects that would need to be undertaken
    for any future such studies (for SLSNe or any other types of transients). First,
    we began with a sample of events nominally classified as SLSNe by two independent
    machine learning-based pipelines (SuperRAENN and SuperPhot). We then applied various
    selection criteria to increase the sample purity (e.g., removing likely AGN flares,
    setting a higher minimum classification probability threshold) at the cost of
    sample completeness. Our sample size following these cuts was 36% of the initial
    sample (24 of the 67). Subsequent to the sample refinement we carried out modeling
    with MOSFiT to extract physical parameters in order to compare the photometric
    sample with existing spectroscopic samples modeled in the same way. The requirement
    for model convergence eliminated 5 additional events from the sample (21% reduction
    from 24 to 19). These two critical steps of sample refinement and modeling will
    be essential for all studies with photometrically-classified samples.

    SLSNe and to the larger sample of spectroscopic SLSNe, we find an overall similarity
    in both observed properties and inferred magnetar and ejecta parameters. We do
    note a potential shift in the photometric sample to slower magnetar spins and
    lower ejecta masses, which may reflect the fact that the photometric SLSNe are
    systematically dimmer than the spectroscopic PS1-MDS SLSNe (due to the shallower
    effective magnitude limit required for spectroscopy). If this is indeed the case,
    then it highlights an important advantage of photometric classification in deep
    surveys (such as PS1-MDS and LSST).

- en: Our initial classifications and the subsequent modeling both rely on the existence
    of redshift information. In the case of our PS1-MDS sample, the redshifts were
    determined from host galaxy spectroscopy after the survey concluded. Such data
    may be difficult to obtain for the large samples expected from LSST (e.g., $\gtrsim
    10^{6}$ SNe per year, and $\sim 10^{4}$ SLSNe per year Villar et al. [2018](#bib.bib55)).
    However, robust photometric redshifts are likely to be as useful as spectroscopic
    redshifts. We also note that one source of contamination in our initial photometric
    sample appears to be AGN (21%, 14 of 67 events) despite the fact that the PS1-MDS
    sample was designed to eliminate variable AGN. These contaminating AGN were again
    identified via host galaxy spectroscopy, which will not be available for the LSST
    samples; a more robust elimination of AGN will be essential.

- en: Overall, our analysis highlights some challenges in constructing pure samples
    of photometrically-classified SNe, but we believe that these challenges are surmountable.
    The photometric sample explored here is smaller than the overall known spectroscopic
    sample by a factor of several, but looking forward to LSST, even a highly conservative
    selection with relatively low completeness will easily exceed the spectroscopic
    sample by two orders of magnitude.
