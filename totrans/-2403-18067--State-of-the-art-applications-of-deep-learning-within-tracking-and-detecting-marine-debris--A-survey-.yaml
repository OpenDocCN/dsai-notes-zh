    outperforms all other methods of object detection but there are many respected
    contributions to this field that have categorically agreed that a comprehensive
    database of underwater debris is not currently available for machine learning.
    Using a small dataset curated and labelled by us, we tested YOLOv5 on a binary
    classification task and found the accuracy was low and the rate of false positives
    was high; highlighting the importance of a comprehensive database.

    debris litter, rubbish or trash of which are all intended to have the same definition.
    Quite simply, these items are disposed of by humans and have found their way into

    other materials; or have been discovered mistaking debris as prey or an object
    to play with, consequently ingesting the toxic materials [McAdam, [2017](#bib.bib59)].
    In fact, a quantitative overview of marine fauna ingesting waste by Kühn and van
    Franeker [[2020](#bib.bib48)] has found that over 700 species are confirmed to
    eat plastic. Additionally, a review on ghost gear by Stelfox et al. [[2016](#bib.bib83)]
    confirmed that up until the time of publication, over 40 species had been recorded
    entangled in ghost fishing gear alone. Ghost fishing gear is defined by NOAA [[2023a](#bib.bib64)]
    as “any discarded, lost, or abandoned, fishing gear in the marine environment.
    This gear continues to fish and trap animals, entangle and potentially kill marine
    life, smother habitat, and act as a hazard to navigation.” Unfortunately, due
    to the consequence of trapped animals either rapidly sinking or being consumed
    by predators, we are unable to detect or fairly estimate the number of entangled
    animals [Sharma and Chatterjee, [2017](#bib.bib79)], [Allen et al., [2012](#bib.bib3)],

    of debris from dives, since 2011\. This means that an impressive 2,132 kg of debris
    is collected a month. Unfortunately, this is problematic as scuba diving is an
    expensive and hazardous method to rely on, debris collection sometimes requires
    special training but most notably manual labour is too slow against the rapid
    influx of debris - the NOAA [[2022](#bib.bib63)] have estimated that approximately
    666,666 tonnes of plastic alone enters the oceans every month (approximately 8
    million metric tonnes a year). This solidifies the reason why automation and artificial

    for automatic identification and counting of coccoliths in sediment samples more

    and trained the ANN using a collection of coccoliths from different species. The

    The data was imagery of a hydro-dam wall with the specific intention to localise
    circular shaped objects of known dimension (the pressure equalisation openings.)
    The proposed architecture involved extracted pixel features from regions of interest
    of approximately the object’s size. In the classification phase, the underwater
    image was decomposed into partially overlapping elementary regions of interest
    and was classified by the SVM based on a shape descriptor (the circularity) of
    the patterns. This shape descriptor was used for their classification as objects
    of interest or not, through a simple threshold comparison. The results showed
    that the proposed architecture minimised the false acceptance and false rejection
    rates. A limitation of this study could be that the researchers selected only
    five images of which were augmented into a 255 image database, therefore, it would
    be interesting to observe the results of this method on a new dataset.

    application of detecting debris underwater. For example, methods such as SYRACO
    present the opportunity to detect and assess complex biological and synthetic
    structures that humans are prone to making errors with. Sonar could present an
    interesting opportunity for application of sonar imaging when detecting basic
    metallic objects underwater - particularly in deeper depths, where the lighting
    conditions make image collection and object detection difficult. The authors do
    specify that as sonar frames cannot detect point features, it would be an unreliable
    method on optical imagery such as video and photo. However, we question if simple,
    well structured objects could still be worth investigating. Meanwhile, utilising
    SVM classifiers on marine footage (particularly deep sea) could assist with problems
    caused by low image quality, low lighting and backscattering from refracted and
    reflected light on microscopic structures.

    problem. Researchers Acuña-Ruz et al. [[2018](#bib.bib1)] tried to address this
    by using three different methods of classification when detecting debris on beaches.
    SVM, RF and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). By using these three models, the
    researchers created a predictive model for the classification of marine debris
    within satellite imagery, of which they could compare and select which models
    were best for specific tasks. Their use of three models also helps to reduce the
    risk of overfitting to help maintain strong performance levels on new data. SVM
    performed the strongest for the classification of debris in satellite imagery
    with an overall accuracy of 80% when validated against ground truth data. It successfully
    detected expanded polystyrene and other plastic mixtures on the beach with a spatial
    resolution between 0.3m to 1.2m and conducted with low errors. The RF and LDA
    models also performed fairly well with accuracies of 77% and 70% respectively.
    Due to weathering processes the authors found that the spectral signatures of

    10,000m3 of materials, including wood (60%), plastic packaging (35%) and ‘other’

    produced a method presenting two weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks;
    RF and U-Net. The RF model used spectral signatures of input features (spectral
    indices, pixel, textural features) extracted from grey-level co-occurrence matrices
    (GLCM). To take the Sentinel-2 multispectral images as an input; the authors used
    a U-Net model which output a binary mask that was able to indicate if debris was
    present or not. To test their benchmark dataset; Kikaki et al. [[2022](#bib.bib44)]
    achieved high accuracy scores and concluded that the MARIDA set is a valuable
    resource for developing and evaluating ML algorithms, when using Sentinel-2 remote
    sensing. Their RF model achieved an overall accuracy of 93%, with a F1 score of
    0.68 whilst, the U-Net CNN achieved a high accuracy of 91%, with a F1 score of
    0.60\. The performance of the models varied between the classes but their results
    for the Marine Debris class had a strong outcome. The use of one class to represent
    all floating debris could cause identification issues due to the vast array of
    structures and objects this classification represents and it is worth mentioning
    that with U-Net the marine debris achieved a 0.7 precision-recall average score

    Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) for detection of floating plastic in the ocean.
    They produced two machine learning models; SVM and RF. The SVM method used the
    kernel; radial basis function (RBF), however, the authors concluded that RF produced
    more promising results, with a higher accuracy; less errors; and less uncertainty
    when classifying plastic pixels from satellite data. Within the RF model, the
    authors used four remote sensing spectral indices; Floating Debris Index (FDI),
    Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Plastic Index (PI) and (as mentioned
    above) the kNDVI. The study also conducted hyperparameter tuning such as the number
    of trees, splits at each node, cost factor and the number of support vectors,
    which optimised their performance. The authors suggest that slightly weathered
    plastic objects may cause the machine learning results to fluctuate, particularly
    as plastic reflects light differently depending on thickness, colour or degradation.
    Despite this, their RF model still achieved 88% and 94% accuracy on their two
    real world test sites; Beirut and Calabria. They conclude by remarking that remote
    sensing and machine learning techniques are a plausible combination for detecting
    marine debris. Based on their research, future studies should take into consideration
    the way in which plastic and other debris degrades over time, as it is possible
    this will affect classification as well as tracking results.

    and accuracy; their mAPs were as low as 31.6% and 47.9% respectively, their analysis
    however makes more sense when the plastic detection average precision is taken
    into account at 70.3% & 82.3% correspondingly, when compared to Faster RCNN’s
    plastic precision score of 83.3%, it seems more feasible, as particularly TinyYOLO
    was significantly faster when using the 1080 GPU, at a rate as fast as 205 frames

    it was slowest when using GPUs, however it outperformed the other models in speed
    when used on the CPU which would operate best on low powered AUVs. Therefore,

    conditions with data collected from height such as UAV and satellite should be

    of light absorption and reflection within differing layers of underwater data
    - the authors suggest incorporating hyperspectral sensors to help distinguish
    plastic from other materials. Due to the 83% mAP and size, they have concluded

    few times within this section. It is a part of the JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth
    Science and Technology) data collection and is popular in many studies, as so
    far it has been the most comprehensive open access collection of sea debris and
    biodiversity footage underwater [JAMSTEC., [2009](#bib.bib41)]. These deep sea
    photos and videos are taken from a submarine off the Japanese coast with varying
    conditions. However, the downside to this database is that it is available for
    multiple uses rather than specifically for machine learning. Therefore, there
    is a lot of data cleaning - some images or footage contain parts of the ROV system
    in place, the quality is not always to a computer vision quality standard and
    the data would need to be labelled appropriately. Hence also why this dataset
    has not been included in 4.1 Benchmark Databases and alternatively, is mentioned

    and satellite data. To produce a ground truth dataset, as well as a dataset used
    to create a predictive model for the classification; the fieldwork collected 144
    samples of various macroplastics and organic material. All of the samples were
    characterised, labelled and where possible, geo-referenced. These were moved to
    be analysed in the lab later. Within the laboratory the team were able to observe
    the spectral signatures of the collected samples using a hyperspectral sensor.
    From each class; the researchers selected 90 pixels from the scene to develop
    a supervised classification predictive model which was split at a 70:30 ratio.
    The other dataset consisted of satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of
    0.31m to classify the debris on the beaches they were observing. Due to atmospheric
    effects on satellite imagery (such as weather), the authors were able to use DigitalGlobe
    to correct the effects.

    to produce different scales; translation; random exposure and contrast [and] multiplication

    was cleaned using a VGG annotator and they were careful to only label clearly
    identifiable debris. Afterwards, the data was combined into one class of ‘debris’
    as the authors claim it improved the detection precision. The decision to limit
    false positive detections by including an additional 3,362 photos of the sea without
    any debris which exhibited a variety of sea states; brought their training set

    the overwhelming assortment of marine debris, they chose to focus on plastics
    as it is the most harmful material in the ocean currently. Regardless of the difficulty
    of obtaining this data, their set - of which they describe to closely mimic the

    Therefore, we decided to test YOLOv5, as it is one of the most prominent methods
    highlighted in the relevant literature as presented in the previous chapters,
    (Git pulled from Singla [[2021](#bib.bib80)]) on our small humble dataset to directly
    compare the results. Our dataset was only a small binary collection of 140 testing
    images (70 for each category and an 80:20 validation split). We chose a binary
    classification of litter and animal, as two classifications was the most popular
    choice across the survey and we wanted to represent as closely as we could. We
    trained the data using batch sizes of 16, 32 and 64 and epochs of 50, 100 and
    150\. The optimal parameter settings was found to be a batch size of 32 and epoch
    number of 50 yet we found that with YOLOv5 we were unable to accurately detect
    the two classifications; there were many false positives and negatives however
    most images including object such as plastic bags were unable to be detected at
    all.

    accuracy rates on current models. We believe it would be highly beneficial to
    train river classification models on wood types, to prevent mistakes in detection
    but also if the algorithm were to be applied to a form of automation, collecting
    wood would not need to be a priority as it is mostly a natural and biodegradable
    material but it might also help to eliminate precious resources - with that in
    mind; potentially harmful types of manufactured woods or those with coatings could
    be an area of classification to explore. van Lieshout et al. [[2020](#bib.bib53)]
