  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The morphological diversity of galaxies is a relevant probe of galaxy evolution
    and cosmological structure formation. However, in large sky surveys, even the
    morphological classification of galaxies into two classes, like late-type (LT)
    and early-type (ET), still represents a significant challenge. In this work we
    present a Deep Learning (DL) based morphological catalog built from images obtained
    by the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Data Release 3 (DR3).
    Our DL method achieves an precision rate of 98.5$\%$ in accurately distinguishing
    between spiral, as part of the larger category of late type (LT) galaxies, and
    elliptical, belonging to early type (ET) galaxies. Additionally, we have implemented
    a secondary classifier that evaluates the quality of each galaxy stamp, which
    allows to select only high-quality images when studying properties of galaxies
    on the basis of their DL morphology. From our LT/ET catalog of galaxies, we recover
    the expected color–magnitude diagram in which LT galaxies display bluer colors
    than ET ones. Furthermore, we also investigate the clustering of galaxies based
    on their morphology, along with their relationship to the surrounding environment.
    As a result, we deliver a full morphological catalog with $164314$ objects complete
    up to $r_{petro}<18$, covering $\sim 1800$ deg², including a significant area
    of the Southern hemisphere that was not covered by previous morphology catalogues.

- en: Galaxy structure was one of the first properties of galaxies that was ever directly
    observed and studied. Initially thought to be ‘nebulae’, it soon became evident
    that these objects showed distinct structural features like spiral arms or a smooth
    elliptical envelope (Zwicky, [1940](#bib.bib128); Vaucouleurs, [1959](#bib.bib112);
    Herschel, [1864](#bib.bib54); van den Bergh, [1998](#bib.bib130)). Decades of
    studying galaxy shapes and structures thus resulted in several classification
    schemes, among which the ‘Hubble tuning fork’ system of classifying galaxies based
    on their observed visual characteristics has been widely used. Collectively known
    as galaxy ‘morphologies’, galaxies can broadly be divided into two main categories
    namely early and late type galaxies. Late type galaxies are formed by spiral (S)
    and irregular/peculiar (Irr) galaxies. The spiral galaxies’ branch, bifurcates
    into barred and un-barred systems. The early type galaxies are composed of elliptical
    and lenticular galaxies. Elliptical galaxies display an increasing ellipticity,
    from round (E0) to flat (E7) systems. Lenticular galaxies lie at the apex of the
    Hubble tuning fork due to their hybrid strucure, presenting a bulge and a disk,
    as spiral galaxies, but without spiral arms.

- en: Such morphological diversity often reflects the presence of different and composite
    stellar populations (Sánchez et al., [2007](#bib.bib96)) and kinematics (Edelen,
    [1969](#bib.bib41); Wang et al., [2020](#bib.bib118)). For example, S galaxies
    are characterized by the presence of a star-forming disk with blue spiral arms,
    which indicate rotationally supported stellar kinematics. E galaxies have, in
    general, more smooth featureless morphologies resulting from a lack of star formation.
    E galaxies present a range of kinematic profiles, being the E0 pressure-supported
    systems or slow rotators, while intermediate elliptical galaxies (E1/E7) present
    and increasing contribution of rotation to the total kinematic budjet (Cappellari
    et al., [2011](#bib.bib22); Bernardi et al., [2019](#bib.bib10)).

- en: Furthermore, galaxy morphologies are found to be tightly correlated to the color
    bimodality observed in galaxy populations, thereby resulting in the existence
    of the younger blue star-forming galaxies with late-type (S) morphologies, and
    the older red passively evolving galaxies with early-type (E/S0) morphologies
    (Baldry et al., [2004](#bib.bib7)). However, we are increasingly discovering that
    several sub-populations of galaxies do not neatly follow this dichotomy, i.e.
    red spirals and blue ellipticals exist (Bamford et al., [2009](#bib.bib9)), and
    likely arise from a variety of physical processes, some of which may be environmentally
    driven (e.g., Vulcani et al., [2015](#bib.bib116)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the evolution of galaxy morphology has always been in tandem with the
    growth of galaxies’ large-scale environment and their masses over cosmic time
    (Desai et al., [2007](#bib.bib37); Calvi et al., [2012](#bib.bib21); Crossett
    et al., [2014](#bib.bib34); Sarkar & Pandey, [2020](#bib.bib98); Wu, [2020](#bib.bib124)).
    Indeed, using a dichotomous ’bulge/disk’ definition for the Hubble-type morphologies,
    the redshift range $1<z<2$ is found to be abundant with bulge+disk systems (e.g.
    Margalef-Bentabol et al., [2016](#bib.bib75)), while massive galaxies in the local
    universe are majorly bulge-dominated (Buitrago et al., [2013](#bib.bib18)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, higher redshift galaxies predominantly show peculiar/disturbed/irregular
    morphologies deviant from the classical morphologies observed at the Local Universe
    (e.g. Mortlock et al., [2013](#bib.bib82)), suggesting that galaxies have undergone
    remarkable structural transformation over cosmic time (see also review by Conselice,
    [2014](#bib.bib31)). Undeniably, galaxy morphology is a crucial evolutionary key
    in tracing and understanding galaxy evolution throughout cosmic times (e.g. Shao
    et al. [2015](#bib.bib100)).

    through multi-band sky surveys, giving us hundreds of thousands of galaxies while
    exploring large volumes of the sky at the same time (e.g., SDSS; York et al.,
    [2000](#bib.bib125)). The diverse methods employed by such sky surveys vary from
    human classification of specialists (Nair & Abraham, [2010](#bib.bib83); Ann et al.,
    [2015](#bib.bib4)), to citizen science (Lintott et al., [2008](#bib.bib69), [2010](#bib.bib70);
    Willett et al., [2013](#bib.bib121); Simmons et al., [2017](#bib.bib101)), or
    from numerically estimating morphology from galaxy properties (Spiekermann, [1992](#bib.bib105);
    Storrie-Lombardi et al., [1992](#bib.bib106); Walmsley et al., [2020](#bib.bib117))
    to novel techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA; Kelly & McKay, [2004](#bib.bib59);
    Wjeisinghe et al., [2010](#bib.bib122)), most of which heavily rely on image quality
    either due to resolution and/or sensitivity of the observations (e.g., Pović et al.,
    [2015](#bib.bib93)). However, migrating to automated methods of classifying galaxies
    is now necessary to deal with the huge data volumes resulting from such current
    and upcoming surveys e.g., the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; Tyson, [2002](#bib.bib111);
    Axelrod, [2006](#bib.bib6)) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory & sky surveys with
    the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Gehrels & and, [2015](#bib.bib45)).

- en: Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful automated tool for extracting useful information
    from complex and varied imaging data sets, and assist in decision-making processes
    such as classification trees. The use of ML thus is limited not only for galaxy
    morphologies (Tohill et al., [2023](#bib.bib110)) but also to detect gravitational
    lenses, interacting galaxies, to classify quasars (Freeman et al., [2013](#bib.bib44);
    Shamir et al., [2013](#bib.bib99); Holincheck et al., [2016](#bib.bib55); Bom
    et al., [2017](#bib.bib12); Ostrovski et al., [2017](#bib.bib87); Ma et al., [2019](#bib.bib73);
    Knabel et al., [2020](#bib.bib61); Zaborowski et al., [2022](#bib.bib126)), and
    more recently to detect outliers in astronomical images (Margalef-Bentabol et al.,
    [2020](#bib.bib76)). These applications highlight the wide-ranging capabilities
    of ML in astrophysical research, enabling researchers to explore and understand
    diverse phenomena in the cosmos. In the last decade, a sub-field of ML known as
    Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as the main technique for computer vision applications
    (Lu et al., [2017](#bib.bib72); Abdel-Hamid et al., [2014](#bib.bib2); Vecchiotti
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib113)), music classification (Choi et al., [2017](#bib.bib29)),

    even raw) data from different sources, and extract relevant features that can
    then be effectively linked to other properties of interest. In particular, Deep
    Neural Networks (DNNs) are high-performance data-driven models that are capable
    of exceeding humans in classification tasks (Metcalf et al., [2019](#bib.bib78)).
    In astronomy, several recent works have exploited this to show that DNNs can indeed
    be successfully used to identify not only the morphological features in raw images
    with minimal human intervention (Glazebrook et al., [2017](#bib.bib46); Lanusse

    hereafter BOM21, our main aim is to apply a high-performance DL algorithm to the
    imaging data, to obtain a novel and reliable morphological catalogue in the Southern
    Hemisphere, with a complementary coverage to other morphological catalogues. Furthermore,
    we also develop the first Deep Network to evaluate the quality of the stamps and
    clean spurious detections. Finally, we take advantage of the high precision photometric
    redshifts derived using the 12 bands in S-PLUS to explore the dependence of morphology
    on the environment and color, used as a proxy for the galaxy stellar population
    properties. We compare the classification presented in this work with Vega-Ferrero
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114)), and we discuss the implications arising by studying
    differently classified objects on the current understanding of galaxy morphological
    categories.

    to cover $\sim 9300{\rm\ deg}^{2}$ of the sky in 12 optical bands. S-PLUS uses
    a wide field optical camera with a field-of-view of 2 deg² and a plate scale of
    0.55″ pixel^(-1). The optical filters (the so-called Javalambre filter system,
    with 5 SDSS-like bands and 7 narrow bands Cenarro et al., [2019](#bib.bib25))
    are quite unique for the southern hemisphere and are optimal for source classification,
    given its better definition of the spectral energy distribution of the observed
    objects, than the usual 4 or 5-band systems. The narrow bands are designed to
    be centered on important stellar features, for instance, the OII line, Ca H+K,
    H$\delta$ and H$\alpha$. The survey reaches a typical limiting magnitude of r$<$21
    AB mag for the broad bands and r$<$20 AB mag for the narrow bands (Mendes de Oliveira

    though, that since the reduction pipeline has been improved between the two data
    releases, new stamps were created using the novel images, to ensure the homogeneity
    of the two data sets (I and II). Another relevant difference between the data
    from DR1 and DR3 is the new photometric calibration applied for the S-PLUS DR3\.
    This calibration consists of fitting synthetic stellar templates to well-known
    data from other surveys, deriving precise zero-points and magnitudes that were
    tested on 170 STRIPE82 fields (see Almeida-Fernandes et al., [2022](#bib.bib3),

    in the 12 bands from the DR3 data access, for both samples.

    However, with more folds the validation set is smaller, the validation loss starts
    to be more unstable, and we found a good trade-off with $7$ folds. Thus, as shown
    in figure [4](#S3.F4 "Figure 4 ‣ 3.1 Training, Validation and Test sample ‣ 3

    Deep Learning in Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey Data Release 3"),
    we define $7$ different training and validations sets, each containing $\sim 85\%$
    and $\sim 15\%$ of the data, respectively. This separation is made so there is
    no match between the validation sample for every fold. Additionally, this method
    guarantees that each object will be used at least once in the test set. We use
    $599$ objects as a test set for performance evaluation, these are not used for

    weights to each class. For a set of $N$ objects in the training set and if the

    process caused by spurious objects. This became no longer feasible due to the
    size of the current and future S-PLUS data releases. Therefore, in this study,
    in order to generate a more robust catalog, we implemented a new DL model to separate
    reliable from non-reliable stamps. To this end, we use stamps that were excluded
    as non-reliable from the DR1 classification as a training sample for this new
    DL model. This approach is advantageous to avoid spurious classifications such
    as faint galaxies in the same field of nearby saturated stars whose spikes can
    affect the accuracy of the magnitude estimation of that galaxy. Given the considerable
    extent of the dataset used in this study, other undesirable objects might include
    artifacts and problematic stamps in general. Therefore, it is essential to count
    with a robust method of distinguishing good images from low-quality images to
    use as an input for the main ETG/LTG DL model.

    of EfficientNet algorithms (Tan & Le, [2019](#bib.bib107)), which are part of
    the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) family-models well-known for having high
    performance on visual pattern recognition problems in standard image datasets
    such as ImageNet (Deng et al., [2009](#bib.bib36)). This kind of Network is based
    on an initial model similar to a MobileNet (MnasNet; Tan et al., [2019](#bib.bib108))
    and can be also scalable by parametrizing the number of layers if needed to gain
    in performance by making a more complex network while constraining the number
    of FLoating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Therefore, each parameter choice
    defining a model and thus defining a family of models. Additionally, this kind
    of model can also be easily adapted to classify datasets with different resolutions
    (Bom et al., [2022](#bib.bib14)). In this contribution we made use of similar
    model based on EfficientNet B2 firstly described in (Tan & Le, [2019](#bib.bib107)),
    with the minor adaptations detailed in BOM21\. For a diagram presenting all the
    layers in this model please refer to figure 5 (b) and (c) in (Bom et al., [2022](#bib.bib14))

- en: Nonetheless, we implemented several innovations compared to the workflow described
    in BOM21\. Firstly, we added a second EfficientNet B2 model to evaluate whether
    a stamp is reliable for morphological classification. The main goal of this NN
    is to identify spurious detections, such as crowded stamps where the central galaxy
    in the stamp is visually indistinguishable, stamps satured by close bright stars,
    and galaxies that are not completely contained in the stamps. We explore how this
    non reliable stamp model would be best defined in terms of inputs. After initial
    tests following Bom21 approach, we used all $12$ bands as inputs in contrast to
    the ETG/LTG model that shown to be best defined in terms of performance and stability
    of results by using $g,r,i$ bands only. Although this choice is based on empirical
    results by adopting the same metrics presented in Bom21, the main difference here
    is likely due to the nature of patterns we are trying to characterize in the Reliable
    Stamp model. By visually inspecting the stamps, we find that some of the spurious
    detections presented large variability of shapes in different bands compared to
    reliable stamps, and thus are likely to be easily distinguishable by using more
    bands. For a full discussion of the band choice for finding ETG/LTG please refer
    to BOM21\. A relevant difference in respect to the main ETG/LTG model developed
    for S-PLUS DR1 is that the probability assigned to a galaxy of being spiral or
    elliptical is no longer complementary, meaning that the sum of such probabilities
    is not equal to one, opening a space for a lot of interesting findings like the
    ones discussed in Section [4.3](#S4.SS3 "4.3 Early-Type and Late-Type Galaxies
    ‣ 4 Results ‣ An Extended Catalogue of galaxy morphology using Deep Learning in
    Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey Data Release 3") and the possibility
    of pointing objects that do not fill in any category. This was implemented by
    changing the neural network activation function in the last layer from a softmax
    to a sigmoid. In figure [5](#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ 3.3 Deep Learning Model ‣ 3 Deep
    Learning classification ‣ An Extended Catalogue of galaxy morphology using Deep
    Learning in Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey Data Release 3") we present
    a scheme of both DL models, detailing the input bands and also presenting an example
    of a given stamp flowing towards some of the network convolutional filters.

    to BOM21, i.e., the probability of being LTG or ETG set to be independent, does
    not seem to affect the performance significantly. Considering the errorbars, we
    did not find significant overfitting over the entire range. However, towards the
    end of the training, around the $15$th epoch the figure suggests the beginning
    of slight overfitting. Furthermore, by evaluating the loss function, the reliable/non
    reliable model, that uses the $12$ band set as the input, presents a more unstable
    behavior: the convergence is slower, around the epoch $15$. The validation presents
    some spikes that might be related to a regularization method present in the network.
    We also notice a tendency of overfitting from epoch $\sim 19$ onwards. The validation
    accuracy does not reach $0.9$ consistently. However, it is worth noticing that,
    differently from the $12$ band model ETG/LTG presented in BOM21, the $12$ band
    model for reliable/non reliable stamps has significant smaller errorbars suggesting
    that the model is robust, although the overall performance compared to ETG/LTG

    perfect classifiers, i.e. with both purity and completeness equal to 1\. This
    threshold $t_{B}$ is set to $\sim 0.60$. To understand the performance outcome
    with this choice we made use of a confusion matrix at the bottom of Figure [7](#S4.F7

    of both ETG and LTG classifications. It is worth mentioning that for this specific

    et al. ([2008](#bib.bib62)); Byrd & Valtonen ([1990](#bib.bib20)); Bournaud et al.
    ([2005](#bib.bib15)). Many of these processes are environment-dependent, i.e.,
    they can occur only in clusters of galaxies (strangulation), or they are more
    likely in the field or groups (e.g., mergers). In general, it is now believed
    that minor mergers are more common than major mergers and that they are the main
    responsible for mass build-up in galaxies (Bournaud et al., [2007](#bib.bib16)).
    Different evolutionary scenarios leave specific imprints on the galaxy morphology;
    i.e. major mergers tend to disrupt the stellar orbits, resulting in pressure dominated
    systems, characterized by an elliptical shape. On the other hand, secular processes,
    or environmentally driven mechanisms, as ram-pressure stripping, affect more the
    gaseous component, chasing the star formation. Moreover, a morphology-density
    relation had been proven in the last decades (Dressler et al., [1997](#bib.bib40);
    Dressler, [1980](#bib.bib39); Cappellari et al., [2011](#bib.bib22); Buitrago
    et al., [2013](#bib.bib18)), where ETG inhabit the densest regions of the Universe,

    are a powerful proof of galaxy evolution as well as structure formation, as we

    reliable stamps with $photo_{z}$ $odds>0.4$ and $r<17$ mag. The magnitude have

    diagram (g-r colour vs r-band absolute magnitude), color coded according to the
    galaxies’ morphologies. The left panel presents the dual classification, where
    elliptical galaxies are shown in orange and spiral galaxies, in light-blue, while
    in the right panel the colour scale shows the probability of being a spiral galaxy.
    It can be seen that elliptical (quiescent) galaxies inhabit the red sequence while
    spiral (star-forming) galaxies are mostly found in the ’blue cloud’ as expected
    according to their dominant stellar populations (see, for example, Wong et al.,
    [2012](#bib.bib123); Lima-Dias et al., [2021](#bib.bib67); Khanday et al., [2022](#bib.bib60)).
    Interestingly, in the right panels it is possible to see that the probability
    of being spiral increases nearly from 0 to 1, going from the red cloud to the
    blue sequence, in a continuous manner. The intermediate region, where the probabilities
    range around $0.5$, is known as Green Valley (see, for example, Zibetti et al.,
    [2007](#bib.bib127)) and it has been largely studied as a region of transition,
    where late-type galaxies could be quenching their star formation, turning into
    late-type galaxies, or early-type galaxies could be ’rejuvenating’, due to some
    interaction with other galaxies or accretion of gas (Smethurst et al., [2015](#bib.bib103)).
    The morphology seems to be reflecting this transformation since the quenching
    is ’removing’ the spiral arms, decreasing the probability of being a spiral galaxy.
    On the other side, a sparkle of star formation in an early-type galaxy could create
    clumps, or star-forming regions, that would increase the probability of being
    a spiral galaxy.

    mass (more massive galaxies are more metal rich at a given time, Leaman et al.

    (spiral galaxies tend to live in low density environment, ellipticals in the center

    a galaxy lives in, would affect both the galaxy mass and stellar population. Note

    and their physics is affected by non-gravitational mechanisms such as baryonic
    effects, radiation pressure, feedback, etc. A simple but powerful tool that can
    bridge the gap between galaxies and the DM distribution is the Halo Model (Cooray
    & Sheth, [2002](#bib.bib32)). One of the consequences of that description is that
    galaxy abundances and their properties (such as stellar mass, color, morphology
    and star formation rate) can be traced back to the DM halos and sub-halos, as
    well as their properties (such as mass, age, concentration and spin) Wechsler
    & Tinker ([2018](#bib.bib119)). From a large-scale structure perspective, the
    correlation function of the DM halos is related to the correlation function of
    the DM particles by the halo abundance, bias, and halo density profile. To a good
    approximation, more massive halos are less abundant and are more highly biased
    with respect to the DM field, but other halo properties such as concentration,
    age, and even spin (angular momentum) also play an important role (Montero-Dorta
    et al., [2020](#bib.bib80)). Galaxies that populate halos and their sub-halos
    inherit those properties, including their bias – but they can also bring additional
    information that is not manifested in the halo properties, and which are indicative
    of the baryonic mechanisms such as ram-pressure stripping. Galaxy morphology is
    one of the additional indicators that can help distinguish between different types
    of halos and their environments, leading to a more accurate and precise description
    of the correlation functions of those tracers.

    classification to assess whether CNNs are able to detect features that human eyes
    do not. To do that, they simulate the appearance that well morphologically classified
    DES galaxies would display at high redshifts, making them fainter and smaller.
    They find that, despite some of the features that distinguish ETGs from LTGs vanish
    after the simulation, the models are still able to correctly classify galaxies
    with an accuracy greater than 97%. The main conclusion of that work is that it
    is possible to correctly classify galaxies from faint and small size images using
    CNNs models, satisfying the following conditions: final apparent magnitude below

    The mismatch for ETG increases to $20\%$ for objects fainter than $r\simeq 17$
    as a result of the fading of the spiral arms in the S-PLUS images. On the other

    a disk as spiral galaxies, but without spiral arms, as elliptical galaxies. van
    den Bergh ([1990](#bib.bib129)) suggests that the ’S0 classification type comprises
    a number of physically quite distinct types of objects that exhibit only superficial
    morphological similarities’. Recent studies based on observations (Fraser-McKelvie
    et al., [2018](#bib.bib43); Coccato et al., [2020](#bib.bib30)) and on simulations
    (Deeley et al., [2021](#bib.bib35)) showed that this class of objects is, indeed,
    composed by two or more sub-groups, formed via different physical mechanisms that
    lead to a similar morphology. Specifically, stripped spiral galaxies could be
    the progenitors of disk-dominated lenticular galaxies, if the gas and arms of
    the spiral galaxies would be removed by interactions with the cluster environment,
    or by harassment in a group environment or generally pestering in all environments
    (Cortesi et al., [2013](#bib.bib33); Jaffé et al., [2015](#bib.bib57); Johnston
    et al., [2021](#bib.bib58)). Another group of lenticular galaxies could be the
    result of major or minor mergers and multiple accretions (Tapia et al., [2017](#bib.bib109)).
    Others, low mass S0s, could be pristine galaxies, formed at redshift $z\simeq
    2$ from mergers of the galaxy stellar/gaseous clumps (Saha & Cortesi, [2018](#bib.bib95)),

    tool to analyse the data and astrotools (Cardoso, [2022](#bib.bib24)) to visualize
    the objects. For complementary visual inspection and some panels the authors made
    use of small cut outs images from the Legacy Survey. The Legacy Surveys consist
    of three individual and complementary projects: the Dark Energy Camera Legacy
    Survey (DECaLS; Proposal ID #2014B-0404; PIs: David Schlegel and Arjun Dey), the
    Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS; NOAO Prop. ID #2015A-0801; PIs: Zhou Xu and
    Xiaohui Fan), and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS; Prop. ID #2016A-0453;
    PI: Arjun Dey). DECaLS, BASS and MzLS together include data obtained, respectively,
    at the Blanco telescope, Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, NSF’s NOIRLab;
    the Bok telescope, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona; and the Mayall
    telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory, NOIRLab. The Legacy Surveys project
    is honored to be permitted to conduct astronomical research on Iolkam Du’ag (Kitt
    Peak), a mountain with particular significance to the Tohono O’odham Nation. The
    authors thanks F. Ferrari and J. Crosset for inspiring discussions and suggestions.'

    classification as robust late or early-type galaxies ($FLAG_{LTG}=5$ and $FLAG_{LTG}=4$,
    respectively) from Vega-Ferrero et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114)). There are 27450
    objects in common ($12\leq mag_{r}\leq 18$), of which 12295 are classified as
    reliable stamps in this work.

    Catalogue of galaxy morphology using Deep Learning in Southern Photometric Local
    Universe Survey Data Release 3") (top panel) present a comparison of objects classified
    as robust LTG in Vega-Ferrero et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114)), dark blue histogram,
    for different magnitudes bins and for reliable and not reliable stamps. The light
    blue and orange histograms classify those objects as late and early-type galaxies
    respectively, as obtained in this work. Figure [22](#A1.F22 "Figure 22 ‣ Appendix
    A Comparison with VF2021 ‣ An Extended Catalogue of galaxy morphology using Deep
    Learning in Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey Data Release 3") present
    the same comparison for objects classified as robust ETG in Vega-Ferrero et al.
    ([2021](#bib.bib114)). The mismatch (number of objects classified differently
    by the two methods) is lower for reliable stamps in both magnitude bins and for
    both classifications (early and late types). Since in this work the probability
    of being early and late-type galaxies is obtained independently and does not always
    sum up to one, it is possible to notice that the mismatch is slightly higher for
    ETG, i.e. objects classified as early types in Vega-Ferrero et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114))
    and as late types in this work. Implications from these findings are discussed
    in Section [5](#S5 "5 Discussion and concluding remarks ‣ An Extended Catalogue
    of galaxy morphology using Deep Learning in Southern Photometric Local Universe
    Survey Data Release 3").

    classified as reliable ETG in this work and as robust late types in Vega-Ferrero
    et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114)), and the opposite case, respectively. As expected,
    some spiral galaxies might be classified as ETG as seen through the T80 telescope,
    due to the lack of resolution (especially for small objects) and depth (for faint
    outer spiral arms) in comparison with DES data. Another interesting case of mismatch
    is low surface brightness galaxies and merging systems.

    early types in Vega-Ferrero et al. ([2021](#bib.bib114)), the majority of cases
    are edge-on objects, red spiral galaxies (Bamford et al., [2009](#bib.bib9); Sodré
    et al., [2013](#bib.bib104)), and disk lenticular galaxies. Several cases of disturbed,
    merging systems are also present.

- en: The full catalogue was made applying the selection criteria established at the
    beginning of subsection 2.1.1 in S-PLUS Data Release 3\. On the other hand, the
    catalogue separated for the training contained galaxies with Petrosian magnitude
    up to 17, thus we separated the full catalog into two groups. The first one is
    the DR3-Blind containing 46763 objects with $r_{petro}<17$ and the second is the
    DR3-Extended that incorporates all the 161635 objects separated by the selection
    criteria with $r_{petro}<18$.

    identify the correspondent objects in DR3\. In case any other column is desired
    one can use these columns to make a match using the Splus Cloud Website. It also
    contains information about 5 broad bands $\{u,g,r,i,z\}$ together with the photometric
    redshift which is also available in S-PLUS data.

    important information from the model calculations. We have 4 columns with the
    probability estimated by the LTG/ETG Model and the Reliable Stamp Model, together
    with 4 additional columns with the correspondent binary probability for those
    columns. The binary probability is given in terms of the threshold selected, so
    if the value in column ProbLTG is greater than $0.6001742$ the column ProbLTG_bin
    will be equal to 1 and so on. With the binary probability we made the column Classification
    that separates the objects into the classes LTG, ETG, AMB1 and AMB0 discussed
    through this work. See table [2](#A2.T2 "Table 2 ‣ Appendix B Catalogue description
    ‣ An Extended Catalogue of galaxy morphology using Deep Learning in Southern Photometric
    Local Universe Survey Data Release 3") for more details concerning the selections
    made in the probabilities for the classification. It’s worth mentioning that the
    Classification column is made only using the LTG/ETG binary probabilities, so
    it has reliable and not reliable stamps in it. If only the reliable stamps are
    desired they can be easily selected using the ProbRel_bin column.
