- en: As smart grids (SG) increasingly rely on advanced technologies like sensors
    and communication systems for efficient energy generation, distribution, and consumption,
    they become enticing targets for sophisticated cyber-attacks. These evolving threats
    demand robust security measures to maintain the stability and resilience of modern
    energy systems. While extensive research has been conducted, a comprehensive exploration
    of proactive cyber defense strategies utilizing Deep Learning (DL) in SG remains
    scarce in the literature. This survey bridges this gap, studying the latest DL
    techniques for proactive cyber defense. The survey begins with an overview of
    related works and our distinct contributions, followed by an examination of SG
    infrastructure. Next, we classify various cyber defense techniques into reactive
    and proactive categories. A significant focus is placed on DL-enabled proactive
    defenses, where we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of DL approaches, highlighting
    their roles and relevance in the proactive security of SG. Subsequently, we analyze
    the most significant DL-based methods currently in use. Further, we explore Moving
    Target Defense, a proactive defense strategy, and its interactions with DL methodologies.
    We then provide an overview of benchmark datasets used in this domain to substantiate
    the discourse. This is followed by a critical discussion on their practical implications
    and broader impact on cybersecurity in Smart Grids. The survey finally lists the
    challenges associated with deploying DL-based security systems within SG, followed
    by an outlook on future developments in this key field.

- en: A smart grid (SG) is an advanced electricity delivery system that leverages
    digital technology to enhance the power grid’s efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.
    The SG facilitates the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and
    wind power, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems, promoting eco-friendly
    electricity generation. It harnesses the potential of cutting-edge technologies
    such as sensors, communication networks, and advanced control systems. This utilization
    enables real-time monitoring and control over the electric power grid [[1](#bib.bib1)].
    The role of SG is crucial in adapting to the dynamic conditions presented by distributed
    generation and renewable energy, with its advanced technologies facilitating the
    bidirectional flow of electrical energy. Its objective is to establish a flexible
    system capable of accommodating power demand, supply, and storage options associated
    with the distribution system. The seamless exchange of data and communication
    among consumers, power utilities, and system operators in SG is made possible
    by implementing smart meters (SMs) in residences, buildings, and industrial facilities,
    a key component of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). SMs observe consumers’
    electricity usage and transmit detailed readings, either through wireless [[2](#bib.bib2)]
    or wired [[3](#bib.bib3)] communications methods. The data is then conveyed to
    the utility company for power quality monitoring and pricing management [[4](#bib.bib4)].
    This can help consumers monitor and manage their energy consumption offering the
    potential for cost savings and a reduced carbon footprint‘ [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system monitors and manages the transmission
    network. However, despite the benefits the SG offers, it is important to address
    the security and privacy issues associated with its implementation [[6](#bib.bib6)].

    that cybercriminals can exploit, which result in disruption of power supply, theft
    of sensitive data, and damage to critical infrastructure [[7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8),
    [9](#bib.bib9)]. Cyberattacks against SG can take many forms, including customer
    data theft, the failure of cyber systems, compromising communication instruments,
    spreading false data and malware, and eavesdropping [[10](#bib.bib10), [11](#bib.bib11)].

    reliability and public safety, as cybersecurity breaches can disrupt the power
    supply and damage critical infrastructure. Implementing robust security measures,
    including incident response and recovery plans, is essential. Within the SG, communication
    protocols such as IEC 60870-5-104 and DNP3 are widely utilized, providing standardized
    data transfer and control commands [[12](#bib.bib12), [13](#bib.bib13)]. However,
    these protocols lack critical security measures like authentication and integrity
    protection, leaving them vulnerable to attacks such as Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
    [[14](#bib.bib14), [15](#bib.bib15)], denial-of-service (DoS) [[16](#bib.bib16)],
    and spoofing [[17](#bib.bib17)]. Such vulnerabilities also extend to other common
    SG protocols like DNP3 [[18](#bib.bib18), [19](#bib.bib19), [20](#bib.bib20)].
    The extended lifetimes of power grid field devices, like protection devices and
    PLCs, further exacerbate the potential for these attacks, underlining the need
    for comprehensive security measures.

    models that support protocols like IEC 61850, enabling communication with intelligent
    electrical devices (IEDs) [[21](#bib.bib21)]. The implementation of IEC 61850
    introduces vulnerabilities that necessitate attention, potentially expanding the
    attack surface [[22](#bib.bib22)]. Modern security mechanisms must seamlessly
    integrate with grid operation devices without disrupting the power supply, but
    some may lack the computational capacity for additional security functions [[23](#bib.bib23)].
    Obsolete protocols pose a security challenge, even during device upgrades [[24](#bib.bib24)].
    SG cybersecurity measures include secure network architectures, communication
    protocols, access controls, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to enhance security
    [[5](#bib.bib5)].

    cyber security involves responding to and mitigating attacks with countermeasures
    such as IDS, incident response, and patch management [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Proactive
    cyber defense emphasizes threat intelligence analysis, security awareness training,
    and continuous monitoring to prevent cyber threats before they begin. To further
    enhance cybersecurity, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques
    are employed. ML refines the performance of countermeasures by training on large
    datasets [[25](#bib.bib25)]. DL, a more advanced subset of ML, uses artificial
    neural networks for real-time detection and response to threats. It automates
    feature extraction in artificial intelligence (AI), reducing the need for manual
    intervention and resource allocation compared to traditional ML methods [[26](#bib.bib26)].
    This approach enables DL to independently tackle complex problems, effectively
    manage unstructured data like images and audio, and suit big data contexts with
    its ability to handle large inputs and diverse outputs [[27](#bib.bib27)]. Additionally,
    DL surpasses traditional methods in cybersecurity with greater precision, lower
    false negative rates, and higher classification accuracy [[28](#bib.bib28)]. Its
    proficiency in managing complex, non-linear data significantly boosts its performance
    in network anomaly detection. DL not only predicts and prevents future threats
    by analyzing historical data to identify patterns and trends, [[29](#bib.bib29),
    [30](#bib.bib30)] but also adapts to the dynamic nature of cybersecurity, making
    it an outstanding choice for advanced, data-intensive applications [[31](#bib.bib31)].
    It is worth mentioning that our paper specifically emphasizes DL-based techniques
    for SG security, recognizing their superior capability in handling high-dimensional
    data and complex patterns. This focus aligns with the established consensus in
    the literature (as in [[32](#bib.bib32), [26](#bib.bib26)]) on the advanced efficacy
    of DL over traditional ML methods.

    with different intentions and strategies. Ding et al. [[33](#bib.bib33)] studied
    attack strategies and their characteristics and explored the potential of using
    AI and blockchain to enhance detection and prevention in SG. Other studies, such
    as those cited in [[34](#bib.bib34), [35](#bib.bib35), [36](#bib.bib36)], focus
    on ML and DL applications in cybersecurity, particularly in SG and IDS. [[34](#bib.bib34)]

    benefits in handling complex data. [[36](#bib.bib36)] aims to enhance detection
    accuracy, reduce false alarms, and detect unknown attacks through a taxonomy framework
    that categorizes IDS literature based on ML and DL approaches. Ferrag et al. [[37](#bib.bib37)]
    discussed seven distinct DL models’ effectiveness, assessing them using specific
    datasets and evaluation metrics. [[38](#bib.bib38)] expands on DL applications
    in SG, including Federated Learning (FL), edge intelligence, and distributed computing,
    highlighting significant applications like energy forecasting and fault detection.
    Several authors have analyzed MTD techniques, including classification and categorization,
    examining methodologies, algorithms, and evaluation methods, but with a noticeable
    lack of emphasis on DL techniques [[39](#bib.bib39), [40](#bib.bib40), [41](#bib.bib41)].

    gradients” issue in recurrent neural networks [[110](#bib.bib110)], which arises
    when the gradients of the network’s weights become very small, making it hard
    for the network to learn. LSTMs use specialized memory cells with gating mechanisms
    to control the flow of information, allowing for access to long-term dependencies
    [[111](#bib.bib111)]. On the other hand, GRUs use a simpler gating mechanism relying
    on a single “update gate” to regulate the flow of information, which allows for
    faster training and less memory usage but may not be as effective in capturing
    long-term dependencies [[112](#bib.bib112)]. Nonetheless, they are still capable
    of retaining long-term dependencies. Compared to LSTMs, GRUs are faster to train

    Q-value function of various states. This function predicts the anticipated cumulative
    reward the agent can obtain by selecting a specific action in a specific state.

    and recovery in Cyber-Physical Power Systems under multiple cyber-attacks [[139](#bib.bib139)].
    It involves a complex system consisting of a representation-learning-based DL
    model, deep AE, and a CNN architecture. The detection problem involves multilabel
    classification, and system recovery is performed based on attack information.
    The MMSE estimator minimizes mean-squared error and provides conditional expectations

    [138](#bib.bib138), [140](#bib.bib140)]. Yao et al. [[137](#bib.bib137)] proposed
    an approach that combines privacy preservation and DL techniques. They utilize
    Paillier Homomorphic Encryption to protect energy usage privacy and employ a combined
    CNN model for analyzing decrypted SM data. The model classifies the data as either
    theft or normal. It employs preprocessing techniques to format the data into image-like
    structures, allowing the CNN model to extract relevant features for accurate classification.
    In [[138](#bib.bib138)], the authors present a novel ETD approach using a large
    dataset of energy usage records from smart meters. They use a deep CNN model with
    convolution and pooling layers for feature extraction and classification. This
    approach emphasizes analyzing power usage patterns to differentiate between normal
    consumers and potential energy thieves, addressing data augmentation challenges.
    The p2Detect framework improves privacy-preserving ETD by optimizing model efficiency
    and accuracy through homomorphic encryption-friendly training, addressing limitations
    in approximations and clustering [[140](#bib.bib140)]. It employs secure cryptographic
    protocols, ciphertext blinding, and padding embedding to safeguard data and model
    privacy. However, it fails to consider security threats from dynamic cyberattacks.
    Integrating online learning and using captured samples for incremental learning
    is recommended. Secure inferencing using encrypted neural networks faces declining
    efficiency due to growing homomorphic encryption parameters [[140](#bib.bib140)].

    measurements and topological connectivity to identify attacks. The model uses
    GNNs with a message-passing technique, a GRU for temporal data, and a residual
    block for vanishing gradients. The effectiveness is assessed using ramp attack
    and FDI attack data, revealing high accuracy in identifying and locating attacks.
    The study also evaluates the model’s sensitivity to attack location and severity,
    revealing areas where attacks are harder to detect. Similarly, authors in [[142](#bib.bib142)]
    proposed a scalable and real-time FDI attack detector as an early detection and
    identification system. Ruan et al. [[143](#bib.bib143)] proposed a strategy using
    spatiotemporal graph DL (STGDL) to identify cyberattacks. The approach extracts
    spatiotemporal features using graph convolution and temporal gated convolution.
    Quantile regression training is utilized to create safe boundaries for state variables
    in SE to identify abnormalities caused by cyberattacks. The proposed super-resolution
    perception network improves temporal learning by creating high-frequency data
    using low-frequency SE results. Boyaci et al. [[145](#bib.bib145)] proposed a
    Chebyshev Graph Convolutional Networks (CGCN) detector to capture the spatial
    correlations of SG data and efficiently model the graph structure of large-scale
    AC power grids addressing FDI attacks. The suggested architecture’s autonomous
    training method eliminates the need for any optimization steps, making it more
    suitable for practical applications. The work in [[144](#bib.bib144)] proposed
    a GNN-based FDI attack detection strategy on smart power grids using a topology-aware
    GAE. It addresses the shortcomings of existing detectors, including the lack of
    spatial embedding or detection of only types of FDI attacks found in the training
    set. The strategy integrates power system topology spatial aspects to better detect

    is a proactive APT detection scheme for IIoT systems, overcoming limitations in
    traditional representations like word2vec [[150](#bib.bib150)]. It models global
    dependencies and encodes the APT attack sequence dataset using BERT’s bidirectional
    transformer encoder. A Softmax regression classifier trains the model for accurate
    classification, leveraging BERT’s transformer architecture and contextual understanding.
    The GTA framework, presented in [[151](#bib.bib151)], employs a transformer-based
    architecture for IoT anomaly detection. It incorporates a connection learning
    policy using Gumbel-softmax sampling to automatically learn the graph structure,
    revealing hidden associations for accurate forecasting. The framework also limits
    the neighborhood scope of each node, enabling efficient anomaly detection. An
    Influence Propagation convolution is introduced to capture anomaly information
    flow. Wang et al. [[152](#bib.bib152)] proposed DDosTC, a novel hybrid neural
    network model designed to detect DDoS attacks on SDN. By integrating scalable
    transformers and CNN architecture, this model effectively addresses vulnerabilities
    and mitigates the risk of potential network collapse. DDosTC comprises a transformer
    layer, CNN layer, and dense layer for feature extraction. Li et al. [[153](#bib.bib153)]
    proposed a method for detecting FDI attacks in SG using transformer, FL, and the
    Paillier cryptosystem. Distributed detection with edge node detectors eliminates
    central workstation and communication delays. The transformer model analyzes electrical
    quantities at edge nodes, allowing precise FDI attack detection. The FL and the
    Paillier cryptosystem encrypt exchanged data, enhancing security and ensuring
    confidentiality against hackers. The Robust Transformer-based Intrusion Detection
    System (RTIDS) is an efficient and accurate IDS for high-dimensional anomaly data
    [[154](#bib.bib154)]. It uses techniques like positional embedding, stacked encoder-decoder
    neural networks, and self-attention mechanisms to reconstruct feature representations
    and classify network traffic. The framework consists of three modules: data preparation,
    RTIDS model construction, and real-time detection. The authors in [[155](#bib.bib155)]
    proposed TGAN-AD to address the challenges in anomaly detection on time series
    data. It combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers to extract
    contextual features from time series data and employs a discriminator to identify
    abnormal data. TGAN-AD demonstrates high accuracy in anomaly detection across
    multiple datasets, such as SWaT, WADI, and KDDCup99. DCT-GAN is a novel approach
    for time series anomaly detection, overcoming challenges like model collapse,
    low generalization capability, and poor accuracy [[156](#bib.bib156)]. It employs
    multiple generators and a single discriminator, enabling the extraction of fine-grained
    and coarse-grained information from time series data. It also incorporates a weight-based
    mechanism to balance the contributions of different generators. The authors in

    system incorporating a masked context reconstruction module into a transformer-based
    self-supervised learning scheme. It aims to capture temporal context and mitigate

    against adversarial attacks. The work of [[159](#bib.bib159)], aims to address
    the susceptibility of DL-based visual sensing systems to adversarial example attacks
    using MTD strategy. The proposed approach deploys multiple models that work collaboratively
    to detect adversarial example attacks and then use MTD to generate new models.
    Serial data fusion with early stopping is also employed to improve defense effectiveness
    and efficiency by reducing inference time and enhancing real-time performance.
    Morphence employs adversarial training on a subset of the model pool [[160](#bib.bib160)].
    It increases the number of models to challenge adversaries through weight perturbation,
    data transformations, and integration. A scheduling strategy selects the most
    confident model for predictions, and the model pool is automatically renewed within
    a predetermined query budget. It also provides an effective defense against repeated
    and correlated attacks. Li et al. [[161](#bib.bib161)] introduced the wAdvMTD
    approach, using pre-built models like 3-layer CNN and ResNet18 for classification.
    The mechanism generates functionally equivalent but structurally different models,
    making the attack vector ineffective against most models, regardless of adversary
    knowledge of model selection. It consists of training and discrimination stages,
    with multiple candidate models working together and using differential voting
    to mitigate perturbations and ensure system resilience against single-point failures.
    Xu et al. [[162](#bib.bib162)] proposed an approach to counter stealthy FDI attacks
    in power system SE. The approach uses LSTM-AE to analyze and learn spatiotemporal
    correlations among adjacent measurements, improving detection accuracy and controlling
    false alarms. It uses iterative normality projection to identify attack vector
    parts. The MTD algorithm uses D-FACTS devices to inject unknown reactance into
    the grid and verify detector decisions. Xu et al. [[163](#bib.bib163)] developed
    a framework combining a data-driven detector and physics-based MTD. The framework
    uses a single LSTM-AE DL model and power system physics data for accuracy. If
    a positive alarm is raised, a neural network-based attack detection technique
    is applied, and a robust MTD algorithm is initiated to confirm the alert. It improves
    detection performance and achieves a high True Positive Rate while minimizing
    false positive rates and rejecting false alarms in real-time.

    Probing [[164](#bib.bib164)]. Each category represents a distinct attack scenario,
    and 41 features are available for each connection record. This dataset is a benchmark
    for intrusion detection research, facilitating supervised learning and algorithm
    evaluation. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the dataset is synthesized
    based on DARPA’98 data, which introduces concerns about its representation of
    real network traffic. The dataset’s coverage of attack types and variations may
    be limited, and its distribution of attack types is imbalanced, which can impact
    its ability to generalize to new patterns. The presence of duplicate records further
    distorts the evaluation of detection algorithms, potentially yielding biased results
    and restricted generalization capabilities [[165](#bib.bib165)]. These characteristics
    highlight the non-stationary nature of the dataset and emphasize the need to account

    and is widely used as a benchmark dataset in network intrusion detection [[166](#bib.bib166)].
    It addresses limitations and evaluates the performance of IDS. This dataset contains
    essential records from the complete KDD dataset, ensuring sufficient records for
    comprehensive experiments. The selection of records from each difficulty level
    is proportional to their percentage in the original dataset. Each record in the
    NSL-KDD dataset consists of 41 attributes representing different flow features
    and a label indicating the presence of an attack or normal behavior [[167](#bib.bib167)].
    The NSL-KDD dataset comprises various network traffic features extracted from
    a simulated environment, including TCP/IP connections with different attack types
    and normal behaviors. It provides separate training and test data files. The training
    dataset shares the same four attack types as the KDDCUP99 dataset[[168](#bib.bib168)].
    To overcome the limitations of the KDDCUP99 dataset, NSL-KDD eliminates redundant
    and unrealistic instances, and it offers a more balanced distribution of attack
    types, addressing the problem of high-class imbalance. This enhancement aims to
    produce an unbiased classifier and reduce false-positive results [[169](#bib.bib169)].

    including sophisticated malware and DoS/DDoS attacks. However, their practical
    application faces challenges, particularly scalability and real-time data processing
    within the vast, dynamic SG networks. The models are particularly susceptible
    to rapid detection of threats, but their extensive computational requirements
    hinder their deployment in real-time environments. This indicates variability
    in the efficacy of the AE and One-Class Classification methodology, which is contingent
    upon the specific model selected—such as PAE, VAE, CNNAE(1D), CNNAE(2D)—and the
    volume of training data incorporated [[10](#bib.bib10)]. As SG evolves, the demand
    for models to adapt to new connections and data without losing accuracy or requiring
    more resources intensifies. While techniques such as DDPG and Multiagent DRL show
    promise in threat detection and response, their performance in more extensive
    and diverse grid contexts is yet to be extensively validated [[30](#bib.bib30),

    examination of the current state of proactive cyber defense strategies utilizing
    DL in SG and IIoT was conducted, as such a broad exploration was previously scarce
    in the literature. We began with an overview of related works and our unique contributions,
    delving into an examination of SG infrastructure. Various cyber defense techniques
    were classified into reactive and proactive categories, with a marked emphasis
    on DL-enabled proactive defenses. We also briefly discussed the intricacies of
    IDS. Subsequently, we highlight potential vulnerabilities and corresponding security
    objectives, underscoring the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive
    risk mitigation against evolving cyber threats. A thorough taxonomy of DL approaches
    was provided, underlining their functions and significance in the proactive protection
    of SG and IIoT. We analyzed the most substantial DL-based methods currently in
    use and explored the interaction between Moving Target Defense, a proactive defense
    strategy, and DL methodologies. The inclusion of an overview of benchmark datasets
    substantiated the discourse. The advancements and limitations of sophisticated
    approaches in cyber threat detection are then discussed, addressing concerns such
    as scalability and real-time reaction in dynamic network settings. The paper concluded
    by addressing the challenges of implementing DL-based security systems within
    SG and IIoT and providing a forward-looking perspective on future developments
    in this crucial field. The insights gleaned underscored the potential of DL in
    transforming the security landscape of SG and IIoT, highlighting the necessity
