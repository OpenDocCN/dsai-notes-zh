- en: Microorganisms play a vital role in human life. Therefore, microorganism detection
    is of great significance to human beings. However, the traditional manual microscopic
    detection methods have the disadvantages of long detection cycle, low detection
    accuracy in large orders, and great difficulty in detecting uncommon microorganisms.
    Therefore, it is meaningful to apply computer image analysis technology to the
    field of microorganism detection. Computer image analysis can realize high-precision
    and high-efficiency detection of microorganisms. In this review, first,we analyse
    the existing microorganism detection methods in chronological order, from traditional
    image processing and traditional machine learning to deep learning methods. Then,
    we analyze and summarize these existing methods and introduce some potential methods,
    including visual transformers. In the end, the future development direction and
    challenges of microorganism detection are discussed. In general, we have summarized
    142 related technical papers from 1985 to the present. This review will help researchers
    have a more comprehensive understanding of the development process, research status,
    and future trends in the field of microorganism detection and provide a reference
    for researchers in other fields.

- en: Microorganisms have a unique ability to adapt to extreme conditions. They are
    found in every environment imaginable. Microorganisms refer to tiny organisms
    with independent living functions, which means they can absorb energy, grow and
    reproduce by themselves. The modern classification of microorganisms are in a
    three-domain system. The system consists of Archaea, Eucarya, and Bacteria [Pepper-2011-EM](#bib.bib1)
    . Bacteria, along with actinomycetes and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) belongs
    to the prokaryotes. Eukaryotes or eukarya includes fungi protozoa, algae, plant,
    and tiny animal. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that belong to neither
    of these two groups [Bitton-2005-WM](#bib.bib2) . Microorganisms play a very important
    role in human life, for better or worse. For example, the presence of plant growth-promoting
    rhizobacteria can encourage beneficial effects on plant health and growth. It
    can also suppress disease-causing microbes [Babalola-2010-BBOA](#bib.bib3) . Deleterious
    rhizobacteria can inhibit plants growth through the production of phytotoxins [Nehl-1997-DRB](#bib.bib4)
    . Lactic acid bacteria can affect humans in many aspects, such as the regulation
    of gastrointestinal flora, the normal operation of human metabolism, and the inhibition
    of the reproduction of harmful bacteria [Masood-2011-BEO](#bib.bib5) . Severe
    acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause fever, discomfort,
    dry cough, shortness of breath and even death in severe case [Hui-2020-TC2](#bib.bib6)
    . In summary, the work of microorganism analysis is of great significance for
    the human being.

    analysis. A stereo scan electron microscopy uses microorganism in soil analysis [Gray-1967-SEM](#bib.bib7)
    . In [Daley-1975-DCO](#bib.bib8) , a modified epifluorscence technique based on
    a microscope is used for aquatic bacteria counting. In [Collins-1993-AOE](#bib.bib9)
    , environmental scanning electron microscopy is used for microorganism analysis.
    However, those microscopic methods have some disadvantages. Firstly, there are
    many types of microorganisms. Estimated in [Locey-2016-SLP](#bib.bib10) , Earth
    is inhabited by $10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ microbial species. Thus the knowledge of experts
    is always inadequate. When experts use this method for microorganism analysis,
    they often have to consult a great deal of literature. Secondly, the training
    cycle for researchers and overall detection time need much time. For example,
    the counting of phytoplankton with traditional microscopic method requires much
    time. Besides, an operator needs to master a great deal of professional knowledge [Embleton-2003-ACO](#bib.bib11)
    . Thirdly, the microorganisms to be analyzed are often of large orders of magnitude.
    It is difficult for microscopic methods to deal with the analysis problem with
    a large amount of data. Large sample size will affect the analysis accuracy of
    operators [Van-2002-OTC](#bib.bib12) . Because of these disadvantages of the microscopic
    method, we need a more efficient method for microorganism analysis. For example,
    computer image analysis is a feasible method.

    Typically, image analysis is used for gaining insight into the raw image and extracting
    the information we need [Umbaugh-2005-CID](#bib.bib13) . In terms of microorganism
    analysis, using image analysis has many advantages over the microscopic method.
    Firstly, image analysis does not care about the number of microbial species. Computers
    can store and remember more information about different kinds of microorganisms
    than experts. The Ribosomal Database Project stores 2460 different species. As
    information is entered, the number will continue to increase [Maidak-2000-TRD](#bib.bib14)
    . Secondly, image analysis takes less time. With the help of image analysis, phytoplankton
    analysis just needs 30 to 40 minutes [Embleton-2003-ACO](#bib.bib11) . Thirdly,
    for image analysis, the task of microorganism analysis of large orders of magnitude
    does not pose any difficulties. Fourthly, the operation of image analysis is simple.
    When using image analysis, necessary operations usually only include import data
    and a few simple steps, such as the Center for Microbial Ecology Image Analysis
    System [Dazzo-2015-UOC](#bib.bib15) . Based on the above reasons, it is feasible
    to apply computer-aided image analysis in microorganism analysis.

    segmentation [Kulwa-2019-ASO](#bib.bib16) , microorganism clustering [Li-2020-AROC](#bib.bib17)
    , microorganism classification [Li-2019-ASF](#bib.bib18) , microorganism counting [Li-2021-ACR](#bib.bib19)
    , etc. However, there is no specific review of microorganism detection. To have
    a comprehensive overview of the existing microorganism detection research, we
    discuss many materials. According to our search, some reviews involve microorganism
    detection. In [Benfield-2007-RRO](#bib.bib20) , the development of plankton-imaging
    systems and advances in extracting information from image data sets timely are
    summarized, where twelve papers involve microorganism detection among all 56 references.
    In [Schaap-2012-LOA](#bib.bib21) , a review of the current status of lab on a
    chip technologies in the context of algae detection and monitoring is presented.
    In this work, there are twenty four papers related to algae detection mentioned
    among all 81 references. In [Gopinath-2014-BDF](#bib.bib22) , a review for existing
    bacterial detection methods is proposed, where methods from manual microscope
    detection to smartphone-based detection are analysed. Twelve papers in this survey
    are related to bacterial detection among all 126 references. One review focuses
    on using computer image analysis to examine the microscopic objects [Puchkov-2016-IAI](#bib.bib23)
    . In this work, twenty-two papers are related to microorganism detection among
    all 102 references. In [Li-2019-ASF](#bib.bib18) , the development history of
    microorganism classification using content-based microscopic image analysis approaches
    is reviewed, where twenty-four papers relate to microorganism detection among
    all 317 references. In [Zhou-2020-RAI](#bib.bib24) , the development of diatom
    testing over the decades is reviewed and a new method of deep learning for diatom
    detection is discussed. In this work, two papers are related to diatom detection
    among all 34 references. Hence, none of these surveys conducts a comprehensive
    study on object detection in microorganism image analysis. In fact, the analysis
    of microorganism detection methods can facilitate development in other microorganism
    image analysis fields, such as microorganism image classification [Zhao-2021-ACO](#bib.bib25)

    detection, the early work is mainly based on classsical image processing methods,
    such as image segmentation [Fukuda-1989-ESD](#bib.bib38) and binarization [Bloem-1995-FAD](#bib.bib39)
    . With the development of the field of machine learning, researches used traditional

    and genetic algorithm-neural network (GA-NN) [Osman-2010-AGA](#bib.bib42) . In
    recent years, deep learning-based methods become very popular, such as faster
    region-convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN) [Viet-2019-PWE](#bib.bib43)
    and Mask R-CNN [Ruiz-2020-SVI](#bib.bib44) . In addition, many new methods can
    be applied in microorganism detection, such as single shot detector (SSD) [Liu-2016-SSM](#bib.bib45)
    . Moreover, visual transformer-based methods have a more robust global information
    representation capability than the current famous CNNs, which means they can eliminate
    the problem of microorganism structure described in the complete image. Therefore,
    the field of visual transformer has developed rapidly in recent years. In fact,
    visual transformer has been applied to cell detection with satisfactory results [Aubreville-2017-AGS](#bib.bib46)
    . However, visual transformer have not yet been applied to microorganism detection,
    although visual transformer based methods show great potential for application
    in microorganism detection, such as squeezeand-excitation (SE) [Hu-2018-SN](#bib.bib47)

    rapidly, although it started late. After consulting a lot of materials, we have
    found 13 researches that are related to deep learning. In [Hung-2017-AFR](#bib.bib80)

    the main criterion is the correlation with the expert counting results or real
    number, such as [Ogawa-2005-MDI](#bib.bib81) , [Hung-2017-AFR](#bib.bib80) . When
    using this kind of criterion, the expert counting results or actual number is

    of detection result for tubercle bacillus(TB) is evaluated by the number of objects
    in sample image and the number of detected objects, shown in Equation [1](#S2.E1

    addition, color features are usually combined with other features for better detection
    performance. In [Kumar-2008-GAO](#bib.bib135) ; [Coltelli-2013-AAR](#bib.bib132)
    , color feature and geometric feature together constitute the feature parameters
    of the object. In [Forero-2003-AIT](#bib.bib134) ; [Fang-2008-AIO](#bib.bib130)
    , color features are regarded as the criteria for the initial screening of regions.

    arrangement properties of the surface of objects. In [Thiel-1995-TAD](#bib.bib139)
    , texture features are employed for detecting and distinguishing Anabaena and
    Oscillatoria. In this work, 14 Anabaena cylindrica and 20 Oscillatoria agardhii
    are prepared as the test group. The exoeriment result shows that the method distinguishes
    between Anabaena and Oscillatoria with an accuracy of over 90$\%$. In [Javidi-2005-TIA](#bib.bib140)
    , a real-time microorganism detection method by applying texture feature and RGM
    method is presented. Experiment result shows that the proposed method has strong
    performance on moving objects and different conditions. In addition, in [Zhai-2010-AIO](#bib.bib127)

    features are simple to compute and insensitive to the exact spatial distribution
    of color pixels. In [Moon-2010-ATM](#bib.bib141) ; [Javidi-2010-DIA](#bib.bib142)
    , a method based on statistical sampling methods is proposed for automated 3-D
    sensing and recognition of biological microorganisms. The specific steps are shown
    in Fig.[19](#S3.F19 "Figure 19 ‣ 3.2.3 Classification Based Methods with Color,
    Texture or Statistical Features ‣ 3.2 Classification Based Methods ‣ 3 Classical
    Image Processing Based Methods ‣ A State-of-the-art Survey of Object Detection
    Techniques in Microorganism Image Analysis: From Classical Methods to Deep Learning
    Approaches"). The test result shows that by comparing the variances, biological
    microorganisms can be accurately detected. In [Daneshpanah-2010-3HI](#bib.bib143)
    , escape-force measurement [Schaa-l2009-MCD](#bib.bib144) is combined with other
    cell identifications for detecting, classifying and controlling microorganisms
    and cells. In [Shin-2010-OSF](#bib.bib145) , a system, which consists of a microfluidic
    device, a digital holographic microscope and relevant statistical recognition
    algorithms, is described for 3-D sensing and detection of microorganisms. Firstly,
    microorganisms are provided by the microfluidic device for the system to process.
    The Fresnel diffraction pattern of microorganisms is then optically recorded as
    a digital hologram. Thirdly, sampling segment features are randomly extracted
    from the reconstructed wavefront data. At last, statistical recognition algorithm
    is applied for cell identification. Microorganisms used in the experiments are
    Euglena acus and Chilomanas. Experimental results suggest that the optical fluid
    3-D sensing and recognition method is feasible. In [Yourassowsky-2014-HTH](#bib.bib146)
    , a system consisting of a Digital Holographic Microscope (DHM) and a partial
    coherent source is proposed for detecting and extracting objects in prepared samples.
    First, a non-zero complex amplitude is applied for determining whether the object
    exists. After that, the inverse Fourier transform and threshold operation are
    performed to obtain the location of the object. To assess the performance of DHM,
    tests are performed with a Giardia lamblia cysts image. Experiments show that
    the obtained phase and intensity images can be used for detection and classification.'

- en: Compared with traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods have
    a wide range of applications and strong applicability. Deep learning methods build
    its network framework by combining multiple simple but nonlinear modules, which
    enables it to design corresponding module combinations to achieve function mapping
    according to different problems [Lecun-2015-DP](#bib.bib178) . In addition, In
    the feature extraction step of detection processing, traditional machine learning
    methods apply handcrafted feature engineering methods, which is labor-intensive
    and time-consuming. Deep learning methods cannot only achieve automatic learning
    of features through its advanced network structure, but also learn complex features
    from simple features. Next, the advantages of deep learning for object detection
    are better represented by introducing some backbones of deep learning networks.

    two structures: VGG-16 and VGG-19\. The deepening of network layers enables VGG
    to obtain larger feature maps. In addition, the superposition of multiple small
    convolution kernels enhances the feature learning ability of VGG. Relevant comparative
    experiments show that VGG can learn more complex and more feature information
    than the previous traditional machine learning. VGG is the backbone of single
    shot detector (SSD) [Liu-2016-SSS](#bib.bib67) , a object detection model with
    high speed and high accuracy. In [Szegedy-2015-GDW](#bib.bib180) , GoogLeNet is

    of obtaining optimal sparse structure with ready-made dense building blocks is
    confirmed by GoogLeNet. GoogLeNet not only deepens the depth and width of the
    network, but also reduces the amount of parameters. In [He-2016-DRL](#bib.bib181)

    modules of Deformable DETR only focuses on a small set of key sampling points.
    This makes Deformable DETR more efficient than DETR. Experiment results on the
    COCO indicate that Deformable DETR is reliable in object detection. Therefore,

    Focal Transformer is proposed, which has similar structure to Swin Transformer.
    Unlike Swin Transformer, Focal Transformer replaces self-attention with Focal
    self-attention. This enables the Focal Transformer to achieve as many attention
    regions as the Swim Transformer at a lower cost. In addition, Focal self-attention
    can combine local information and global information more efficiently. Comparative

- en: Based on the analysis of the development of microorganism detection methods,
    the future development trend and challenges are predicted. The most promising
    development in this field can be the combination of existing detection models
    and visual transformer. Due to the successful applications of transformer in natural
    language processing, many researchers are trying to apply visual transformer to
    multiple computer vision tasks. Therefore, methods by combining visual transformer
    and others have the potential to yield good performance in the field of microorganism
    detection. One of the challenges can be real-time detection. With the development
    of related technologies, the requirements for detection speed are getting higher
    and higher. In many aspects such as microbial tracking, pathogen detection and
    wild microbial monitoring, the detection speed will significantly affect its practical
    application. Moreover, the difficulty of obtaining good quality microorganism
    data and high processing costs leads to obtaining insufficient dataset with poor
    quality, which encounters the experimental results. The problem of insufficient
    data sets and poor quality is a major challenge for microorganism detection. However,
    the Environmental Microorganism Image Dataset Seventh Version (EMDS-7) is available
    publicly [Yang-2021-EEM](#bib.bib252) . This dataset has 41 types of environmental
    microorganisms. As a multi-object dataset, it has 13216 objects in 2365 images.
    Furthermore, all 2365 images have corresponding labeling files in “.XML”. Considering
    the huge development prospect in the field of microorganism detection, it is believed
    that more and more teams will produce high quality databases like EMDS-7.
