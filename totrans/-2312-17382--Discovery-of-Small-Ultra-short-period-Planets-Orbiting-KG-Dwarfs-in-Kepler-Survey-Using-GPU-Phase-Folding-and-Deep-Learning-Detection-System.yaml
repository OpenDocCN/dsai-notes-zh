- en: 'Since the discovery of the first hot Jupiter orbiting a solar-type star, 51
    Peg, in 1995, more than 4000 exoplanets have been identified using various observational
    techniques. Despite this, only a few hundred of these detected planets possess
    sub-Earth radii. The formation process of these sub-Earths remains elusive, and
    acquiring additional samples is essential for investigating this unique population.
    In our study, we employ a novel GPU Phase Folding algorithm combined with a Convolutional
    Neural Network algorithm, termed the GPFC method, on Kepler photometry data. This
    method enhances the transit search speed significantly over the traditional Box-fitting
    Least Squares method, allowing a complete search of the known Kepler KOI photometry
    data within hours using a commercial GPU card. To date, we have identified five
    promising sub-Earth short-period candidates: K00446.c, K01821.b, K01522.c, K03404.b,
    and K04978.b. A closer analysis reveals the following characteristics: K00446.c
    orbits a K dwarf on a 0.645091-day period. With a radius of 0.461 $R_{\oplus}$,
    it ranks as the second smallest USP discovered to date. K01821.b is a sub-Earth
    with a radius of 0.648$R_{\oplus}$, orbiting a G dwarf over a 0.91978-day period.
    It is the second smallest USP among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the
    NASA Exoplanet Archive. K01522.c has a radius of 0.704 $R_{\oplus}$ and completes
    an orbit around a Sun-like G dwarf in 0.64672 days; K03404.b, with a radius of
    $0.738R_{\oplus}$, orbits a Sun-like G dwarf on a 0.68074-day period; and K04978.b,
    with its planetary radius of 0.912$R_{\oplus}$, orbits a G dwarf, completing an
    orbit every 0.94197 days. Three of our finds, K01821.b, K01522.c and K03404.b,
    rank as the smallest planets among all confirmed USPs orbiting G dwarfs in the
    Kepler dataset. The discovery of these small exoplanets underscores the promising
    capability of the GPFC method for searching for small, new transiting exoplanets
    in photometry data from Kepler, TESS, and future space transit missions.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to prevailing solar system-based planet formation theories, which do
    not predict planets with orbits significantly narrower than Mercury’s, ultra-short-period
    (USP) planets represent a captivating group of exoplanets with orbital periods
    of less than a day. These USPs may offer vital insights into the early evolution
    of planetary systems and the dynamics of star-planet interactions, including tidal
    forces and atmospheric erosion. The most extreme USPs, e.g. KOI1843.03 (K2-137b),
    have orbital periods of just 4 hours, teetering on the edge of tidal disruption
    (Rappaport et al., [2013](#bib.bib18); Smith et al., [2017](#bib.bib22)). Found
    in approximately 0.5% of Sun-like stars, USPs typically have radii smaller than
    2$R_{\oplus}$ or, in the case of ultra-hot Jupiters, greater than 10$R_{\oplus}$
    (Sanchis-Ojeda et al., [2014](#bib.bib19)). Understanding how these planets achieve
    such short orbital periods remains one of the longest-standing unresolved problems
    in the field.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To date, three leading theories are proposed to explain the formation of ultra-short-period
    planets: in situ formation, migration driven by stellar tides, and tidal migration
    coupled with multi-body interactions (Adams et al., [2020](#bib.bib1)). The in
    situ formation theory, which posits that these planets formed near their present
    orbits, is deemed less plausible due to the extreme temperatures these close-in
    orbits would encounter (Boss, [1998](#bib.bib3)). Moreover, given that host stars’
    radii were significantly larger during their pre-main sequence phase compared
    to now (Palla & Stahl, [1991](#bib.bib17); D’Antona & Mazzitelli, [1994](#bib.bib6)),
    USP planets in closer proximity would likely have been engulfed by the stars.
    Meanwhile, the role of tidal migration in the genesis of these planets remains
    an active area of investigation (Dawson & Johnson, [2018](#bib.bib7)). Given that
    USPs are often observed with outer accompanying planets in longer orbits, it is
    hypothesized that USP origins involve interactions among the sibling planets,
    which reposition USPs into their current positions closer to their host stars,
    possibly in orbits previously occupied by the stars themselves.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of its origin, once a planet settles into a short-period orbit, the
    host star’s influence may remove it in a few billion years. For volatile-rich
    planets, high atmospheric temperatures and intense stellar irradiation they endure
    can lead to atmospheric loss (Owen & Kollmeier, [2019](#bib.bib16)). Additionally,
    strong tidal forces can cause orbital decay, pushing these planets into a state
    of unstable Roche lobe overflow. Such destabilization can culminate in the complete
    disruption of their atmospheres after just a few orbits (Jia & Spruit, [2016](#bib.bib12)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main limitation in studying the enigmatic USP planets has been the scarcity
    of USP planets discovered so far. To date, there are only 43 USPs confirmed by
    the Kepler survey and 127 in the NASA confirmed planets archive. Assessing the
    relative abundance of USPs, including variations in orbital periods, planetary
    mass, the spectral type of their host stars, and the configurations of any associated
    multiplanet systems, is vital for testing theoretical models. However, the small
    sample size of known USPs means that current estimates of their occurrence rates
    are subject to large error margins. Therefore, expanding the USP data set is imperative
    for gaining a deeper understanding of this group.

- en: The GPFC method, as detailed in Wang et al. ([2023](#bib.bib24)) and applied
    to the Kepler survey dataset, has facilitated the discovery of new USP planets
    presented in this paper. GPFC combines a novel Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
    phase folding algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance transit
    detection. A key advantage of GPFC is its proficiency in detecting low Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) planetary signals by processing raw light curves directly from the
    Kepler survey, independent of the TCE catalog. Meanwhile, GPFC operates at a speed
    three orders of magnitude faster than the predominant Box-fitting Least Squares
    (BLS) method, while also delivering higher precision. It outperforms BLS by achieving
    a higher true positive rate for the same false positive rate of detection and
    offers higher precision at the same recall rate. Furthermore, in a blind search
    of Kepler light curves, GPFC successfully recovers 100% of known ultra-short-period
    planets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GPFC method comprises four main stages, specifically designed to identify
    transiting exoplanet candidates from time-domain surveys. Initially, raw light
    curves undergo preprocessing, which involves removing outliers and correcting
    for long-term stellar variability. Subsequently, these light curves are phase-folded
    at various trial periods that are evenly distributed across the USP search range
    of (0.2,1] days, utilizing the GPU phase folding technique. The resultant folded
    curves are then normalized and fed into the CNN module. This module evaluates
    whether potential exoplanet transits exist at any of the trial periods. Light
    curves that receive high scores from the CNN module are further scrutinized in
    the vetting process.

    sourced from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes. Generated by the Kepler
    Science Processing Pipeline (Jenkins et al., [2010](#bib.bib11)), these light
    curves contain integrated flux measurements taken at 1766-second intervals, spanning
    approximately four years and encompassing 30,000 to 70,000 epochs. Additionally,
    the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) data set, as recorded in the NASA Exoplanet
    Archive as of June 2023, was also downloaded. This archive contained 9564 dispositioned
    KOIs, including 2350 confirmed planets, 2366 candidates, and 4848 false positives.

    excluding stars hosting planets designated as ’False Positive’ or ’Candidate’
    in the Kepler disposition field. Our focus was solely on stars with all planets
    classified as ’Confirmed’ or ’Candidate’. This pre-selection strategy ensured
    that our dataset was free from the influence of secondary eclipses typically caused
    by eclipsing binaries. Such eclipses, not documented in the KOI catalog, could
    not be reliably masked and thus posed a risk of contaminating our analysis. By
    filtering out these stars, we substantially reduced the likelihood of false positive
    detection in our study.

    outlined in (Vanderburg & Johnson, [2014](#bib.bib23); Shallue & Vanderburg, [2018](#bib.bib21)).
    Initially, we flattened the light curve by iteratively fitting it with a b-spline,
    masking all confirmed transits. During this process, $3\sigma$ outliers were progressively
    discarded. Subsequently, the light curve was divided by the best-fit spline. We
    then produced a "no-transit" light curve by excluding all known planet transits
    listed in the KOI catalog, priming the light curve for potential new planet discoveries.
    This no-transit curve served as the input for our fast GPU phase folding module.

    phase folding on it. Given the absence of prior knowledge regarding a potential
    transit’s period, we sampled 100,000 trial periods across our period search range.
    For USP planet detection, our study concentrated on the USP period range of (0.2,
    1] days, though the methodology can be adapted to different ranges. Using the
    GPU phase folding algorithm, the no-transit curve is folded and binned for each
    of the 100,000 periods, yielding 100,000 folded results, each being 256 in length
    post-binning. The high precision of folding is pivotal to the search’s success
    since minor signals from shallow transits can be easily obscured with a slight
    time deviation. The GPU’s grid system enables the simultaneous folding of the
    100,000 trial periods, requiring approximately 5 seconds to fold a single curve

    After masking known TCEs and phase-folding based on the orbital period, a search
    for the primary eclipse was undertaken using BLS. No eclipses were discernible
    for any of the host stars—KIC4633570, KIC8832512, KIC12266636, KIC8409295, or

    periodic re-calibrations, approximately every 90 days, to ensure its solar panels
    remained oriented towards the Sun. This necessitated that stars were re-positioned
    on different segments of the CCD array (Shallue & Vanderburg, [2018](#bib.bib21)).
    Sometimes, contamination signals could be introduced into the light curve more
    strongly in some positions on the CCD than others, causing differences in the
    strength and depth of transit signals on each CCD. We checked that the transit
    signals did not change significantly depending on which CCD module the target
    stars were observed. Figure [12](#S4.F12 "Figure 12 ‣ 4.1 Candidate Vetting Process

    one used in Shahaf et al. ([2022](#bib.bib20)). For each candidate raw light curve,
    we injected random time intervals between its consecutive quarters, with the intervals
    selected in the range from 0 to the detected transit period specific to the candidate.
    Post this temporal perturbation, we fed the time-shifted light curve into our
    GPU-based folding and CNN processing pipeline to find the most prominent periodogram
    peak and subsequently computed its SNR. This procedure was repeated a total of
    ten times for each target, allowing us to determine the mean SNR and its corresponding
    standard deviation across the ten iterations. In setting our validation criteria,
    we mandated that the SNR associated with the detected transit should be larger
    than four times the standard deviation gleaned from the ten bootstraps. All of
    our candidates passed this bootstrap validation criterion.

- en: 9\. Inversion Validation To further differentiate the transit signals from non-planetary
    sinusoidal or alike periodic signals, we performed an inversion test by inverting
    flux values around their nominal baseline thus converting the troughs of a light
    curve into crests and vice versa (Adams et al., [2021](#bib.bib2)). Given that
    our pre-processing step ensures that the average flux value of a normalized light
    curve equals to 1, the inversion process generates a new light curve with its
    flux values equal to 2 minus their original values. The inverted light curve was
    then processed by our GPU folding and the CNN pipeline to discern the potential
    presence of a transit signal. To the end, none of the inverted light curves of
    our candidates displayed signals close to their detected transit periods therefore
    passing the inversion test.

    not the result of contaminations from scattered background light, we undertook
    an outside apertures test (Shallue & Vanderburg, [2018](#bib.bib21)). For each
    candidate under consideration, we constructed light curves derived from pixels
    situated outside the optimal Kepler aperture. These light curves were subsequently
    folded based on their respective detected transit periods. Should the transit
    signals emanating from the background be significantly more pronounced than those
    from the on-target pixels, it would be indicative of potential contamination.
    Our test results showed showed no significant signals, which proved the transit
    signals have their source on or near the target star.

    candidates found in light curve data. In essence, it provides the probability

- en: 'The Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm (Hippke & Heller, [2019](#bib.bib10))
    is pivotal in our methodology, serving as the backbone for the evaluation of light
    curve data. Upon input of a light curve, TLS generates a spectrum of Signal Detection
    Efficiency (SDE) scores, each corresponding to a distinct orbital period. The
    utility of SDEs in FAP calculations is twofold: they are both noise-normalized
    and deterministic. This characteristic is crucial, given the diverse signal-to-noise
    ratios (SNRs) encountered in light curves. Noise normalization ensures that the
    SDE metric is consistent across varying SNR levels, facilitating the development
    of a universal model for the FAP relationship. Additionally, the deterministic
    nature of SDEs, derived directly from empirical light curve data, allows for consistent
    SDE values for a specific transit signal across different light curves, assuming
    comparable SNR. This consistency is achievable through precise configuration of
    the TLS settings, reinforcing the reliability of SDE as a robust metric in our
    analysis.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The construction of the FAP statistic commenced with the selection of four KOIs,
    from which all known transit signals were removed, followed by a detrending process
    of the light curves. Leveraging these detrended baselines, we generated 250 bootstrap
    replicas for each, culminating in a dataset of 1000 synthetic light curves. These
    were then analyzed using the TLS algorithm, which provided SDE scores across specified
    orbital periods. Our search, concentrated on USP planets, dictated the confinement
    of TLS processing to an orbital period range of (0.2, 1] day. The maximal SDE
    value extracted from each light curve formed a dataset of 1000 SDEs. From this,
    we constructed a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), delineating the relationship
    between SDE and 1-FAP. Further analysis involved fitting the Probability Distribution
    Function (PDF) of these SDEs with a log-normal distribution, which yielded an
    exemplary fit (PROVIDE MEASURE OF FIT). This log-normal model of the PDF was then
    transformed into a CDF model, establishing a smooth and continuous correlation
    between SDE and 1-FAP. Finally, we calculated the FAP values by subtracting the
    1-FAP percentages from unity, thereby deriving the definitive SDE-FAP relationship
    model for our study.

    by simply running the detrended light curves through TLS to obtain the SDE of

- en: For verification of the SDE-FAP model we used synthetic light curves with pure
    white-noise to produce the SDE-FAP relationship. To do this we produced 1000 light
    curves consisting of pure white-noise. The SNR of each these light curves was
    set by drawing a random SNR from a uniform distribution of values representing
    the range of SNRs seen in real Kepler light curves. These light curves were then
    inputted to the GTLS algorithm which provided the SDE-period spectra. The GTLS
    software was configured to only evaluate the period range of (0.2, 1.0] day. The
    maximum SDE of each light curve was then used to produce a PDF to which a log-normal
    model was fit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the final verification step of the SDE-FAP relationship model, we used the
    light curves of our candidates to produce a new SDE-FAP model. This step was taken
    to ensure that the model still holds true for these targets which would indicate
    that the candidate transit signals we found were likely not produced by red noise.
    This test procedure was identical to that which we used to construct the original
    SDE-FAP model. That is, for each light curve, we removed all known transits then
    detrended. Then each light curve was bootstrapped to produce 250 new light curves.
    After using GTLS and producing the log-normal fit to the PDF of the SDE maximums,
    we derived a SDE-FAP relationship model for each candidate.

    type of their host stars. Based on Kepler data, (Sanchis-Ojeda et al., [2014](#bib.bib19))
    deduced that M-dwarfs are roughly 10 times more likely than F-dwarfs to host a
    USP planet with a radius double that of Earth’s. Diving deeper into the NASA confirmed
    planet archive, we corroborated that the occurrence rate of USPs diminishes as
    the host star’s effective temperature rises (as detailed in Table [3](#S5.T3 "Table

    that while 0.7% of confirmed USP planets in the NASA archive orbit F-type stars,
    a significant 8.0% revolve around M-type stars, marking them as ten times more
    prevalent. Our findings introduce an additional USP in the vicinity of a K-type

    multiplanet systems and systems with three planets drops to 13.8% and 5%, respectively.
    This disparity could suggest that the Kepler survey might underreport multiplanet

    planetary companions (Sanchis-Ojeda et al., [2014](#bib.bib19); Winn et al., [2018](#bib.bib25);
    Adams et al., [2020](#bib.bib1)). As posited by (Sanchis-Ojeda et al., [2014](#bib.bib19)),
    even USP systems devoid of known siblings likely house additional, non-transiting
    planets. Assuming multiplanet interactions—such as tidal migration or dynamical
    excitation—are crucial in positioning USPs onto their present orbits, the detection
    of a USP would naturally suggest a comprehensive follow-up search for other, yet
    undetected, sibling planets in the same system. Furthermore, (Winn et al., [2018](#bib.bib25))
    emphasized that multiplanet systems encompassing a USP distinguish themselves
    from other Kepler multiplanet systems. While the typical Kepler multiplanet system
    without a USP exhibits period ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4 between adjacent planet
    pairs, systems with an inner USP characteristically maintain a larger period ratio,
    exceeding 3, between the USP and its adjacent outer companion. Our discoveries,
    as detailed in Table [5](#S5.T5 "Table 5 ‣ 5.3 Multiplanet Systems ‣ 5 Discussions

    within the Kepler dataset utilizing our innovative GPFC method. This approach
    fuses the power of GPU phase folding with the signal detection capability of a
    Convolutional Neural Network. One significant advantage of the GPFC method is
    its ability to process raw light curves from the Kepler survey independently of
    the TCE catalog. Credit to GPU parallelism and our meticulously calibrated CNN
    model, the GPFC system can analyze all confirmed planets in the KOI catalog within

    K00446.c, with a radius of 0.461 $R_{\oplus}$, ranks as the second smallest USP
