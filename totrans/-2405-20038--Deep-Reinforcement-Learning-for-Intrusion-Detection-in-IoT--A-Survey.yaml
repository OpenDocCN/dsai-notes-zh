- en: The rise of new complex attacks scenarios in Internet of things (IoT) environments
    necessitate more advanced and intelligent cyber defense techniques such as various
    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) which are responsible for detecting and mitigating
    malicious activities in IoT networks without human intervention. To address this
    issue, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proposed in recent years, to
    automatically tackle intrusions/attacks. In this paper, a comprehensive survey
    of DRL-based IDS on IoT is presented. Furthermore, in this survey, the state-of-the-art
    DRL-based IDS methods have been classified into five categories including wireless
    sensor network (WSN), deep Q-network (DQN), healthcare, hybrid, and other techniques.
    In addition, the most crucial performance metrics, namely accuracy, recall, precision,
    false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), and F-measure, are detailed,
    in order to evaluate the performance of each proposed method. The paper provides
    a summary of datasets utilized in the studies as well.

- en: The Internet of things (IoT) has evolved significantly in the past few years,
    allowing the interconnection of multiple devices as well as improving communication
    and data exchange. IoT has become increasingly integral to modern daily life through
    enhancing connection, efficiency, and comfort in numerous domains. IoT transforms
    the way we interact with our surroundings, by simply linking devices, sensors,
    and systems. It has affected users’ daily lives in many ways like industrial control
    systems (ICSs) which are used to connect, monitor, and control physical processes
    in industrial environments such as manufacturing, smart grid, smart transportation,
    and connected agriculture. IoT has brought healthcare and tele-medicine opportunities
    by advancing and perfecting services. IoT devices are vulnerable to plenty of
    cyber threats, including intrusion and illegal access, thus this interconnection
    also brings up severe security and privacy concerns [[1](#bib.bib1)]. IoT environments
    are threatened by many attacks and malicious activities that might affect the
    integrity and security of connected devices and networks. In this context, IDSs
    become particularly crucial because of their importance in mitigating threats.
    An IDS is software that continually scans the network for activities that might
    indicate an impending assault [[2](#bib.bib2)]. IDSs serve an essential role in
    protecting IoT networks by detecting and mitigating attacks and responding to
    threats in real-time [[3](#bib.bib3), [2](#bib.bib2)]. The IDSs are commonly created
    with AI methods like machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) approaches [[1](#bib.bib1)].
    One such approach of ML is the utilization of reinforcement learning (RL). In
    order to develop efficient IDSs in IoT environments, deep reinforcement learning
    (DRL), a sub-field of ML, has emerged as a potential method. DRL combines the
    strengths of DL which enables the model to learn complex representations and patterns
    and allows the system to make sequential choices.

    adapt and learn from the changing dynamics of IoT networks. DRL-based IDSs also
    can autonomously make decisions on whether network activities are normal or indicative
    of intrusion attempts. The benefits of using RL in IDS include the adaptability
    to evolving attack patterns, real-time decision-making capabilities, and proficiency
    in handling complex threats. The integration of RL into IDS holds the potential
    to considerably improve their efficacy, precision, and responsiveness in identifying
    and countering cyber threats.

    research. In [[4](#bib.bib4)], a brief overview of IDS in cloud computing (CC)
    is provided. The authors review the challenges and risks linked to CC environments.
    They discuss various IDS’s approaches and their ability to identify and mitigate
    intrusions. Moving on, valuable details about IDSs were discussed in [[5](#bib.bib5)].
    The paper covered a review of IDS approaches using both ML, and DL in cloud environments
    where the authors explore multiple IDS techniques in this area. A comprehensive
    review of rule learning-based IDS and their potential applications in the context
    of smart grids (SGs) are presented in [[6](#bib.bib6)]. The paper examines multiple
    elements related to IDS, such as techniques for feature selection, evaluation
    metrics, and rule development. It underlines how much is important the rule learning-based
    IDS in identifying and mitigating security threats in SGs.

    in our review. Q-learning is a model-free RL technique that seeks to determine
    the best possible reward $(r)$ resulting from taking a specific action $(a)$ in
    a given state $(s)$. The Q-table acts as the core of RL, summarizing all potential
    outcomes $r_{i}(a_{i},s_{i})$. By exploring various actions and gradually exploiting
    knowledge, the agent learns to select actions that maximize cumulative rewards
    within a Markov decision process (MDP) environment. Deep Q-network (DQN) is an
    advancement of Q-learning that replaces the Q-table with a deep neural network
    (DNN) model to meet real-time requirements. Double deep Q-network (DDQN) represents
    a progressive evolution of DQN, employing a paired DNN architecture. Deep deterministic
    policy gradient (DDPG) is an algorithm that combines DQN and policy gradient (PG)
    methods, as detailed in [[9](#bib.bib9)]. This algorithm empowers IDSs to make
    informed decisions and improve their capability to detect complex and evolving
    cyber threats effectively. Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is a technique
    that amalgamates the principles of both RL and federated learning (FL). IDSs utilize
    this technique to enhance threat detection. Agents learn from distributed data
    sources, leading to improved accuracy and adaptability in dynamic environments.'

    WSN and IoT by using DRL. The authors address the limitations of traditional IDS
    by introducing the formalism of MDP to improve performance such as surveying,
    controlling data networks in real-time, and increasing the quality of surveillance.
    The researchers also use the deep Q-network and the NSL-KDD dataset to boost their
    aims in WSN and IoT. Furthermore, they compared the method against ML k-nearest
    neighbors (KNN) algorithm. In terms of detection accuracy rate and FPR, the experimental
    evaluation shows that the DRL-IDS surpasses traditional IDS techniques, it works
    well in detecting various types of attacks such as DoS, DDoS, and intrusion attempts.
    In [[11](#bib.bib11)] explain an innovative approach to intrusion detection in
    WSNs that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) and acro-critic in RL
    strategies. The authors use GANs and RL algorithms in order to find solutions
    to the challenging problems of detecting and reducing intrusions and attacks in
    WSNs. The GAN model produces authentic network traffic data, and an RL agent is
    used to distinguish between normal and malicious activity. The GAN-generated data
    is employed to supplement the training dataset, which boosts detection accuracy.
    The findings show that the GAN-RL-based IDS is capable of properly detecting and
    mitigating intrusions in WSNs. The proposed model was compared with a convolution
    neural network (CNN), back-propagation (BP), and support vector machine (SVM).
    The proposed GANs with RL strategies has been found to have great potential in
    enhancing security measures in WSNs among the other compared methods. The article
    [[12](#bib.bib12)] discusses the problem of intruder tracking in energy-efficient
    sensor networks. It provides a unique sensor scheduling approach to reduce the
    consumption of energy while promising excellent intrusion detection. The authors
    offer a dynamic sensor scheduling system that intelligently selects a subset of
    sensors to activate based on the anticipated position of the intruder. The proposed
    strategy tries to decrease overall network energy usage while retaining adequate
    coverage to follow the intruder correctly by carefully arranging sensor activations.
    The framework proposed in [[13](#bib.bib13)] proposes a combined approach that
    utilizes RL for intrusion detection and cuckoo search technique (CST) for improving
    the optimal route in WSNs. The cuckoo search algorithm was introduced in this
    work as an effective optimization technique to improve routing path optimization
    in WSN. The suggested RLID technique was compared to the BTMA, this technique
    detects and isolates the intrusion, reducing the latency and has a lower FPR.

    to improving decision performance in IDSs, when using the IoT. To identify possible
    attacks, the suggested solution uses the capabilities of IoT devices to collect
    and examine data from various sources. The authors used DRL with deep Q-neural
    network in binary attacks and multi-attack classification. In addition, this work
    contains two steps, the first is to employ the RL approach for initial learning,
    and the second one is for attack detection and classification. Metrics like accuracy
    rate, DR, and false alarm rate (FAR) are used by the authors to assess the decision
    performance of an IDS. The proposed model was compared with five ML algorithms
    namely: DQN, MLP, cascade ANN, PCA_GWO, and GMM-KF, using different datasets.
    The proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the ambient intelligence
    approach in achieving improved real-time decision performance compared to traditional
    IDSs. Another suggested approach in [[15](#bib.bib15)] proposes deep monitoring,
    a unique traffic monitoring solution that utilizes FDRL, to address the problem
    of successfully detecting cybercrimes in IoT networks. To collect data on traffic
    flow, deep monitor employs software-defined networking (SDN) in IoT networks.
    The suggested approach dynamically controls flow rules in SDN switches to maximize
    traffic flow statistic details while avoiding flow table overflow. To enable the
    deep monitor agents to learn and make decisions in real time depending on the
    current traffic situation, the authors use DRL algorithms, notably the DDQN. The
    FL approach enhances the learning performance of the DDQN algorithm by enabling
    decentralized collaboration across agents in order to handle the heterogeneity
    and scalability of IoT systems. Studies done in an SDN simulation environment
    show how well deep monitor protects edge devices from the overflow problem and
    offers fine-grained traffic monitoring capability. Kalnoor et al. in their study
    [[16](#bib.bib16)] IDS performance evaluation using a MDP-based model is described
    in detail, where the use of MDP forms the core of a new framework that accurately
    captures how an IDS behaves dynamically when it detects and responds to intrusions.
    Multiple factors are taken into account, including accuracy in identifying threats
    along with rates of incorrect predictions, when evaluating the efficacy of the
    IDS. By simulating several attack scenarios, the authors illustrate the utility
    of their MDP-based approach in measuring the performance of the IDS and adjusting
    its parameters. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and evaluation
    of IDS in IoT networks, as well as recommendations for improving their performance.
    The proposed MDP was compared to CNN and MLP algorithms.'

    (AS-IDS) system, which combines anomaly-based and signature-based methodologies
    to improve IoT network security. To discover odd behaviors or patterns in IoT
    materials, the AS-IDS technique applies anomaly detection, which employs deep
    Q-learning (DQL). The system also includes signature-based detection which compared
    observed network traffic to known threat signatures. They thoroughly explain the
    design and implementation of the AS-IDS system, highlighting its ability to detect
    five types of attacks in IoT environments. The evaluation of the performance of
    AS-IDS has been conducted using accuracy and FPR, they also work with NSL-KDD
    dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AS-IDS
    system in detecting intrusions and protecting IoT networks. Another hybrid scheme
    proposed by Tharewal et al. [[18](#bib.bib18)] discusses the security concerns
    posed by the industrial internet of things (IIoT) by employing an IDS based on
    DRL using proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO2) and rectified linear unit
    (ReLU) as an activation function as depicted in Figure 3\. This method combines
    deep learning’s observation capability with DRL, to develop an IDS capable of
    detecting and reducing intrusions in IIoT networks. The proposed methodology was
    compared to ML algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, RNN and to other DRL methods such
    as DDQN and DQN. The experimental findings and performance assessment data demonstrate
    how successful the IDS is at detecting intrusions in IIoT networks compared to
    SOTA methods.

    healthcare via the use of IoT technology and cryptographic encryption to protect
    against many types of intrusions, such as DoS and man-in-middle (MIM) attacks.
    The authors determine how IoT devices might be integrated into healthcare systems
    to improve patient monitoring, data collecting, and communication and offer a
    scheme to safeguard the transmitted data. Zhang and their colleagues in [[20](#bib.bib20)]
    propose a federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-based IDS to address security
    challenges in IoT-enabled healthcare systems. Furthermore, the authors raised
    the existing dangers in IoT devices as well as the necessity of protecting sensitive
    healthcare data, they introduce an FDRL, where DRL algorithms are used to educate
    IDS models on distributed IoT devices locally. The models learn and exchange information
    collectively while protecting data privacy. By exploiting the collective intelligence
    of distributed IoT devices, the recommended IDS improves the system’s capacity
    to detect and avoid intrusions. Figure [5](#S3.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ III-D Application

    in energy-efficient IoT devices. The researchers address the problem of detecting
    intrusions while taking into account the energy limits of IoT devices. They propose
    a DDPG based method for balancing intrusion detection accuracy and energy usage.
    Through continuous interactions with the environment, the algorithm learns an
    effective policy for IDS. The performance of the proposed technique demonstrates
    its effectiveness in detecting intrusions while utilizing the least amount of
    energy. The results indicate that the proposed DDPG-based algorithm has the ability
    to achieve effective and energy-efficient intrusion detection in green IoT systems
    through multiple factors like precision, TPR, FPR and F1-score. Moving on, the
    reference [[23](#bib.bib23)] highlights the increasing number of malware targeting
    IoT devices and the limitations of traditional intrusion detection approaches
    in IoT networks. The proposed defense system utilizes SDN and network function
    virtualization (NFV) [[24](#bib.bib24)] to enhance network security. The core
    component of the system is a DRL agent that evaluates the risks of potential attacks
    and takes optimal actions to mitigate them. Another reference [[21](#bib.bib21)]
    examines the challenge of intrusion detection in IoT systems and provides an online
    intrusion detection framework. To successfully identify intrusions in real-time,
    the system integrates full bayesian possibilistic clustering (FBPC) with ensembled
    fuzzy classifiers, to divide IoT data into clusters based on membership degrees.
    This allows the representation of data patterns to be flexible and granular. The
    data inside each cluster is then classified as normal or intrusive thanks to ensembled
    fuzzy classifiers.
