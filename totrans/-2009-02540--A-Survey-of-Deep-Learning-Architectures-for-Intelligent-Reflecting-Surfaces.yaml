- en: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have recently received significant attention
    for wireless communications because it reduces the hardware complexity, physical
    size, weight, and cost of conventional large arrays. However, deployment of IRS
    entails dealing with multiple channel links between the base station (BS) and
    the users. Further, the BS and IRS beamformers require a joint design, wherein
    the IRS elements must be rapidly reconfigured. Data-driven techniques, such as
    deep learning (DL), are critical in addressing these challenges. The lower computation
    time and model-free nature of DL makes it robust against the data imperfections
    and environmental changes. At the physical layer, DL has been shown to be effective
    for IRS signal detection, channel estimation and active/passive beamforming using
    architectures such as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. This
    article provides a synopsis of these techniques for designing DL-based IRS-assisted
    wireless systems.

- en: The next-generation millimeter wave (mm-Wave) massive multiple-input multiple-output
    (MIMO) systems require large antenna arrays with a dedicated radio-frequency (RF)
    chain for each antenna. This results in expensive and large system architectures
    which consume high power and processing resources. To reduce the number of RF
    chains while also maintaining sufficient beamforming gains, hybrid analog and
    digital beamforming architectures were introduced. However, the resulting cost
    and energy overheads using these systems remain a concern. Recently, intelligent
    reflective surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a feasible solution [[1](#bib.bib1)]
    to implement low cost and light-weight alternative to large arrays complexity
    in both outdoor and indoor applications, usually with separate operating frequencies
    or spectral bands. (Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Survey of Deep

- en: An IRS is an electromagnetic two-dimensional surface that is composed of large
    number of passive reconfigurable meta-material elements, which reflect the incoming
    signal by introducing a pre-determined phase shift. This phase shift is controlled
    via external signals by the base station (BS) through a backhaul control link.
    As a result, the incoming signal from the BS can be manipulated in real-time,
    thereby, reflecting the received signal toward the users. Hence, the usage of
    IRS enhances the signal energy received by distant users and expands the coverage
    of the BS. It is, therefore, required to jointly design the beamformer parameters
    both at the IRS and BS. This achieves desired channel conditions, wherein the
    BS conveys the information to multiple users through the IRS [[2](#bib.bib2)].
    Different from amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems, an IRS can have both active
    and passive components, which can provide a flexible configuration, thus, it has
    less active transmit modules or totally reflects the received signal as a passive
    surface. Thus, the IRS is much more energy- and spectrum-efficient [[3](#bib.bib3)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The accuracy of beamformer design strongly relies on the knowledge of the channel
    information. In fact, the IRS-assisted systems include multiple communications
    links, i.e., a direct channel from BS to users and a cascaded channel from BS
    to users through IRS. This makes the IRS scenario even more challenging than the
    conventional massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, the wireless channel is dynamic
    and uncertain because of changing IRS configurations. Consequently, there exists
    an inherit uncertainty stemming from the IRS configuration and the channel dynamics.
    These characteristics of IRS make the system design very challenging [[4](#bib.bib4),
    [2](#bib.bib2)].

    The channel needs to be estimated for multiple communication links, i.e., BS-user
    and BS-IRS-user [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Finally, beamformers are designed (by solving
    complex optimization problems) for phase shifters at both BS and passive elements

    Introduction ‣ A Survey of Deep Learning Architectures for Intelligent Reflecting
    Surfaces")). To leverage DL for signal detection, [[5](#bib.bib5)] devised a multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP) for mapping the channel and reflecting beamformer effected data
    symbols to the transmit symbols. The MLP is a feedforward neural network (NN)
    composed of multiple hidden layers. The framework in [[5](#bib.bib5)] uses three
    fully connected layers. Once the MLP is trained on a dataset composed of received-transmitted
    data symbols for Rayleigh fading channels, each user feeds the learning model
    with the block of received symbols. These blocks account for the effect of channel
    and beamformers. Then, MLP yields the estimated transmit symbols.

    estimates the data symbols directly, without a prior stage for channel estimation.
    Thus, this method is helpful reducing the cost of channel acquisition. However,
    a few challenges remain to achieve a reliable performance. The training data should
    be collected under several channel conditions and different beamformer configurations
    so that the trained model learns the environment well and reflects the accurate
    performance in different scenarios. This is a particularly challenging task because

    channel state acquisition is a major task in IRS-assisted wireless systems. A
    common approach is to turn on and off each individual IRS element one-by-one while
    also using orthogonal pilot signals to estimate the channel between the BS and
    the users through IRS. In particular, IRS channel estimation via DL involves constructing
    a mapping between the received input signals at the user and the channel information
    of direct and cascaded links (Fig. [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Survey
    of Deep Learning Architectures for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces")). In this
    way, DL-based techniques reduce the pilot percentage and complexity in channel
    estimation stage [[7](#bib.bib7)].

    channels via twin convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, the received pilot
    signals at the user are collected by sequentially turning on the individual IRS
    elements. Then, the collected data are used to find the least squares (LS) estimate
    of the cascaded and the direct channels. Both CNNs are trained to map the LS channel
    estimates to the true channel data. The upshot is that each user estimates its
    own channels only once and feeds the received pilot data (LS estimate) to the
    trained CNN models. The CNNs have higher tolerance than MLP against the channel
    data uncertainties, imperfections (such as switching mismatch) of IRS elements.

    for various channel/user/configurations, the system may lack sufficient computational
    capability. This is overcome by FL-based training [[7](#bib.bib7)], where the
    learning model updates are computed at the devices (nodes) and aggregated at the
    BS (central server) (Fig. [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ IV-A Beamforming at the IRS ‣
    IV DL-Aided Beamforming for IRS Applications ‣ A Survey of Deep Learning Architectures
    for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces")), thereby eliminating the transmission of
    raw data. FL significantly reduces the transmission overhead since the size of
    the datasets is usually larger than the size of the learning model, and its performance
    improves as the number of users increases [[7](#bib.bib7), [13](#bib.bib13)].
    Furthermore, instead of using two CNNs demanding two datasets as in [[6](#bib.bib6)],
    a single CNN in [[7](#bib.bib7)] jointly estimates both cascaded and direct channels.

    performance is upper bounded by the centralized model training, i.e., training
    the model with the whole dataset at once. Therefore, the prediction performance
    of FL is usually poorer than the centralized learning (CL). As shown in Fig. [3](#S4.F3
    "Figure 3 ‣ IV-A Beamforming at the IRS ‣ IV DL-Aided Beamforming for IRS Applications
    ‣ A Survey of Deep Learning Architectures for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces")),
    CL and FL frameworks are compared with the minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) and
    the LS estimation. We note that FL performs slightly poorer than CL in high SNR
    regimes. Despite this, FL significantly reduces the transmission overhead, e.g.,
    approximately ten-fold reduction in the number transmitted symbols [[7](#bib.bib7)].

    training overhead. In this context, compressive channel estimation with deep denoising
    neural networks (DDNNs) is very effective [[8](#bib.bib8)]. It employs a hybrid
    passive/active IRS architecture, where the active IRS elements are used for uplink
    pilot training and passive ones for reflecting the signal from the BS to the users.
    Once the BS collects the compressed received pilot measurements, complete channel
    matrix is recovered through sparse reconstruction algorithms such as orthogonal
    matching pursuit (OMP). Then, DDNN is used to improve the channel estimation accuracy
    by exploiting the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the mm-Wave
    channel in angular-delay domain. During training, the input is the OMP-reconstructed
    channel matrix and the output is the noise, i.e., the difference between the OMP
    estimate and the ground truth channel data. This method leverages both CS and
    DL yielding a performance better than using these techniques individually. The
    major drawback is the additional hardware complexity introduced by the active
    IRS elements.

    in designing the reflect beamforming weights using active IRS elements [[8](#bib.bib8)].
    These elements are randomly distributed through the IRS. They are used for pilot
    training, after which compressed channel estimation is carried out using OMP.
    In order to collect the dataset, the reflect beamforming weights are optimized
    by using the estimated channel data. Finally, a training dataset is constructed
    with channel data and reflect beamformers as the input-output pairs for an SL
    framework. Note that the active IRS elements present similar shortcomings as in [[8](#bib.bib8)].
    However, the method in [[9](#bib.bib9)] excels by leveraging DL for designing
    beamformers.

- en: The labeling process in [[9](#bib.bib9)] demands solving an optimization problem
    for each channel instance in training data generation stage. One possible way
    to mitigate this is to use label-free techniques, such as UL. The UL approach
    in [[10](#bib.bib10)] for reflect beamforming design employs MLP with five fully
    connected layers. The network maps the vectorized cascaded and direct channel
    data input to the output comprising the phase values of the reflect beamformers.
    The loss function is selected as the negative of the norm of the channel vector,
    which may seem like an unsupervised approach because it does not minimize the
    error between the label and learning model prediction. However, this technique
    yields the phase information at the output uniquely for each training samples.
    Consequently, the beamformers implicitly behave like a label in the training process.
    In [[10](#bib.bib10)], the output of the NN is a design parameter, i.e., reflect
    beamformer phases, which have the complexity of beamformer optimization for each
    input.

    [[11](#bib.bib11)] employed RL to design the reflect beamformers for single-antenna
    users and BS. The RL is a promising approach which directly yields the output
    by optimizing the objective function of the learning model. First, the channel
    state is estimated by using two orthogonal pilot signals. An action vector is
    selected either by exploitation (using prior experience of the learning model)
    or exploration (using a predefined codebook). After computing the achievable rate
    based on the selected action vector from the environment, a reward or penalty
    is imposed by comparing with the achievable rate with a threshold. Upon reward
    calculation, a Deep Quality Network (DQN) (Fig. [5](#S4.F5 "Figure 5 ‣ IV-D Beamforming
    for Indoor IRS ‣ IV DL-Aided Beamforming for IRS Applications ‣ A Survey of Deep
    Learning Architectures for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces")) updates the map
    from the input state (channel data) to the output action (action vector composed
    of reflect beamformer weights). The training data is generated in an electromagnetic
    (EM) simulation tool, and this process is repeated for several input states until
    the learning model converges. While RL is not an IRS-specific technique, it is
    particularly useful in lowering the overhead of labeling process as compared to
    SL architectures deployed by RNN or CNN models, which require labeled datasets.
    The RL algorithm learns reflect beamformer weights based on the optimization of
    the achievable rate. Thus, RL presents a solution for online learning schemes,
    where the model effectively adapts to the changes in the propagation environment.
    However, RL techniques have longer training times than the SL approaches because
    reward mechanism and discrete action spaces make it difficult to reach the global
    optimum. The label-free process implies that the RL usually has slightly poorer
    performance than the SL.

    [[2](#bib.bib2)]. Here, actor-critic network architectures are used to compute
    actions and target values, respectively. First, the learning stage is initialized
    by the use of input state excited by cascaded and direct channels. Given the state
    information, a deep policy network (DPN) (actor) constructs the actions (reflection
    beamformer phases). Here, the DPN provides a continuous action space that converges
    faster than the DQN architecture in [[11](#bib.bib11)]. The action vector is used
    by the critic network architecture to estimate the received signal-to-noise-ratio
    (SNR) as objective. This SNR then yields the target beamformer vector under the
    learning policy. Using the gradient of DPN, the network parameters are updated
    and the next state is constructed as the combination of the received SNR and the
    reflecting beamformers.

    data generation, training approaches in [[2](#bib.bib2), [11](#bib.bib11), [12](#bib.bib12)]
    demand expensive transmission overhead to be trained on huge datasets. This is
    mitigated in FL techniques. The FL approach in [[13](#bib.bib13)] learns the IRS
    reflect beamformers by training an MLP by computing the model updates at each
    user with the local dataset. The model updates are aggregated in a parameter server
    (PS), which is connected to the IRS. The MLP input is the cascaded channel information
    and the output labels are IRS beamformer weights. The federated architecture lowers
    the transmission overhead during training. However, it is assumed that the PS
    is connected to the IRS. The simple architecture of the IRS could make this infeasible.
    It is more practical to access the PS via BS for model training.

    hardware complexity is a major issue in these methods. The low-cost, less complex
    IRS-based systems have the potential to mitigate these problems. The RL-based
    secure beamforming [[14](#bib.bib14)] minimizes the secrecy rate by jointly designing
    the beamformers at the IRS and BS to serve multiple legitimate users in the presence
    of eavesdroppers. The RL algorithm accepts the states as the channel information
    of all users, secrecy rate and transmission rate. Similar to [[2](#bib.bib2)],
    the action vector are beamformers at the BS and IRS. The reward function is designed
    based on the secrecy rate of users. A DQN is trained to learn the beamformers
    by minimizing the secrecy rate while guaranteeing the quality-of-service requirements.
    The model training takes place at the BS, which is responsible for collecting
    the environment information (channel data) and making decisions for secure beamforming.
    This scheme is more realistic and reliable than that of [[11](#bib.bib11), [2](#bib.bib2)],
    which ignore the effect of eavesdroppers. The learning model includes high-dimensional
    state and action information, such as the channels of all users and beamformers
    of BS and IRS. This may necessitate more computing resources for training than
    non-secure IRS [[11](#bib.bib11), [2](#bib.bib2)] and conventional SL techniques [[6](#bib.bib6),
    [9](#bib.bib9)].

    is very demanding for the BS to optimize the transmit power every time when the
    on/off status of IRS elements is updated. This could be addressed by accounting
    energy-efficiency in the beamformer design problem. In [[4](#bib.bib4)], a self-powered
    IRS scenario maximizes the energy-efficiency by optimizing the transmit power
    and the IRS beamformer phases. In this DQN-based RL approach, the BS learns the
    outcome of the system performance while updating the model parameters. Thus, the
    BS makes decisions to allocate the radio resources by relying on only the estimated
    channel information. The dataset for the RL framework has states selected as the
    estimated channels from users and the energy level of the IRS. Meanwhile, the
    action vector includes the transmit power, the IRS beamformer phases and on/off
    status of the IRS elements. The learning policy is based on the reward which is
    selected as the energy-efficiency of the overall system. However, this work considers
    only IRS beamforming and ignores the same at the BS.

    design problem in an indoor communications scenario to increase the received signal
    strength (RSS) (see Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ A Survey of Deep
    Learning Architectures for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces")). This is particularly
    useful from the perspective of low hardware complexity because it eliminates deployment
    of multiple BSs to improve RSS. The MLP architecture in [[3](#bib.bib3)] accepts
    two-dimensional user position vector and yields the IRS beamformer phases at the
    output. Since the channel data is not employed as input, the network does not
    have to deal with severe environmental fluctuations. However, the learning model
    trains on specific room environments and may perform poorly for different room
    conditions or different obstacle distribution in the same room. This is mitigated
    in RL-based solutions which are highly adaptive to different environments [[11](#bib.bib11),
    [2](#bib.bib2)].

    modulation types [[5](#bib.bib5)]. The prerequisites for channel estimation and
    beamforming are even more tedious because of additional labeling process. This
    is difficult to overcome in, especially online scenarios. Apart from SL, the label-free
    structure in RL is particularly helpful but at the cost of training times. It
    is possible to relax the data collection requirements by realizing the propagation
    environment in a numerical EM simulation tool [[11](#bib.bib11), [9](#bib.bib9)]
    and then using a more realistically simulated data. This is helpful in constructing
    the training dataset offline but chances of failure remain in a real world scenario.
    Very recently, public datasets for channel estimation problem in IRS-aided communications
    were made available in the 2021 IEEE SIgnal Processing Cup competition.

    PS connected to the BS. In addition, the model training complexity increases with
    the number of IRS elements and IRSs deployed between the users and the BS. Some
    experimental studies include IRS with $10000$ elements operating at $10.5$ GHz [[1](#bib.bib1)].
    Hence, huge transmission overhead is introduced for model training. The FL has
    potential to reduce this cost and enable a communication-efficient model training
    (see, e.g., Fig. [3](#S4.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ IV-A Beamforming at the IRS ‣ IV DL-Aided

    beamforming, user scheduling, power allocation, and antenna selection/switching.
    Addressing the trade-off between the bias and the variance of the model output
    is essential for robust performance. This is usually achieved through data validation
    so that the learning model does not either over-fit or under-fit the training
    data. Nonetheless, this does not generalize the learning performance to different
    environments. Moreover, the current DL architectures for wireless systems remain
    environment-specific because the input data space of their learning model is limited.
    As a result, the performance degrades significantly when the learning model is
    fed with the input from unlearned/uncovered data space. In order to cover larger
    data spaces and provide a robust performance against the changes in the environment,
    wider and deeper learning models are required. But the current DL architectures
    for wireless communications comprise less than a million neurons and and are composed
    of only a few layers (Table 1) [[7](#bib.bib7)]. Therefore, wider and deeper designs
    are of great interest for future DL-based IRS-aided systems.
