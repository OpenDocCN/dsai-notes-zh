  zh: 摘要
- en: Deep learning (DL) has proven its unprecedented success in diverse fields such
    as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by its
    strong representation ability and ease of computation. As we move forward to a
    thoroughly intelligent society with 6G wireless networks, new applications and
    use cases have been emerging with stringent requirements for next-generation wireless
    communications. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the potential of DL
    approaches in satisfying these rigorous needs and overcoming the deficiencies
    of existing model-based techniques. The main objective of this article is to unveil
    the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of DL-based physical layer methods
    to pave the way for fascinating applications of 6G. In particular, we have focused
    our attention on four promising physical layer concepts foreseen to dominate next-generation
    communications, namely massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, sophisticated
    multi-carrier waveform designs, reconfigurable intelligent surface-empowered communications,
    and physical layer security. We examine up-to-date developments in DL-based techniques,
    provide comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and introduce a comprehensive
    guide for future directions. We also present an overview of the underlying concepts
    of DL, along with the theoretical background of well-known DL techniques. Furthermore,
    this article provides programming examples for a number of DL techniques and the
    implementation of a DL-based multiple-input multiple-output by sharing user-friendly
    code snippets, which might be useful for interested readers.

    DL 方法在满足这些严格需求和克服现有基于模型的技术不足方面的潜力。本文的主要目标是揭示基于 DL 的物理层方法领域的最前沿进展，为 6G 的迷人应用铺平道路。特别是，我们关注了四个有望主导下一代通信的有前景的物理层概念，即大规模多输入多输出系统、复杂的多载波波形设计、可重构智能表面赋能通信和物理层安全。我们考察了基于
    DL 的技术的最新发展，提供了与最先进方法的比较，并介绍了未来方向的全面指南。我们还概述了 DL 的基本概念，并介绍了著名 DL 技术的理论背景。此外，本文提供了多种
    DL 技术的编程示例，并通过分享用户友好的代码片段实现了基于 DL 的多输入多输出，这可能对感兴趣的读者有所帮助。

    Release-15 standard in March 2017, the brand new 5th generation ([5G](#glo.acronym.5g))
    wireless communication technology has made significant progress worldwide [[1](#bib.bib1)], [[2](#bib.bib2)].
    3GPP completed the Release-17 Stage-2 freeze in June 2021 and is planning the
    next freeze in March 2022 [[3](#bib.bib3)]. As these releases have been proceeding,
    the deployment process of 5G has attained a high level of maturity. According
    to a recent GSA report, 176 operators from 72 countries had launched commercial
    5G networks as of August 2021 [[4](#bib.bib4)]. However, the recent advancements
    in the implementation of 5G have exposed the drawbacks and limitations of this
    technology despite being nominated as the primary enabler of Internet-of-Everything
    ([IoE](#glo.acronym.ioe)) systems [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Even though 5G has introduced
    more flexibility and efficiency to wireless networks by utilizing new technologies
    such as millimeter-wave ([mmWave](#glo.acronym.mmwave)) communication and multi-numerology
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([OFDM](#glo.acronym.ofdm)), the pledged
    revolutionary mobile communication perspective has remained a pipe dream thus
    far [[5](#bib.bib5)], [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Moreover, although 5G systems are ready
    to support data rate-hungry enhanced mobile broadband services and ultra-reliable
    low-latency communications, it is questionable whether they can support future
    IoE applications [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Therefore, researchers have been investigating
    sophisticated communication technologies and developing intriguing concepts for
    6th generation ([6G](#glo.acronym.6g)) wireless networks, which are projected
    to come into life after 2030\. Even if cellular communication systems have advanced
    to a new level with the development of 5G, expectations of the intelligent information
    society of 2030 and beyond will be remarkably compelling. 6G will be the essential
    provider of a highly digital community by connecting everything, enabling almost
    unlimited wireless coverage, establishing full-vertical networks, and supporting
    holographic and high-precision communications for tactile and haptic applications [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    In addition, new IoE services ranging from extended reality applications and flying
    vehicles to space travel and brain-computer interfaces will come to reality with
    6G networks, making 6G the true master of IoE [[5](#bib.bib5)], as illustrated
    in Fig. [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive
    Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures"). However, these new and fascinating
    applications will bring strict and very challenging requirements such as ultra-high
    reliability, low latency, substantially high data rate, high energy and spectral
    efficiency, and dense connectivity. Fig. [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary
    PHY Architectures") compares the specifications of 5G and 6G, elucidating the
    6G expectations [[8](#bib.bib8)]. The developments and expectations on the way
    toward these 6G technologies in the literature have also been comprehensively
    reviewed and discussed by some other research groups [[9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10),

- en: AI has a long and successful history, dating back to approximately 1940s when
    neural networks ([NN](#glo.acronym.nn)) first appeared in intelligent systems.
    Machine learning ([ML](#glo.acronym.ml)) and deep learning ([DL](#glo.acronym.dl))
    approaches have been proven to be competitive frameworks over the years for challenging
    tasks such as computer vision, robotics, and natural language processing, in which
    building a concrete mathematical model is relatively difficult. For example, although
    it is almost mission impossible to develop an analytical model or robust algorithm
    for detecting handwritten digits (digit recognition) or different objects in an
    image (image segmentation), DL techniques can accomplish these tasks with a performance
    exceeding human level. On the other hand, communication technologies hinge on
    numerous mathematical models and theories requiring expert knowledge, such as
    information theory and channel modeling. Information signals stream from optimal
    transmitter designs with modulation, coding, and signaling schemes over a range
    of mathematically defined channel models to be reliably detected at the receiver,
    in which each block is optimized individually. In addition to this well-defined
    PHY architecture, the ability of secure transmission along with eliminating various
    hardware imperfections makes communications a complicated and mature field. Therefore,
    ML and DL techniques must reach lofty goals to outperform existing technologies
    and provide discernable advantages. Applying DL approaches to optimize the building
    blocks separately, ranging from modulation and coding schemes ([MCS](#glo.acronym.mcs))
    to symbol detection and channel estimation algorithms, would not produce much
    of a change [[25](#bib.bib25)]. End-to-end ([E2E](#glo.acronym.e2e)) optimization
    of communication systems as a whole in complex scenarios, such as unknown channel
    models and ultra-high mobility conditions, is the most fascinating concept that
    we expect to see in 6G, and we call this PHY revolution. Switching from the block
    structure of current PHY communications, where each block is responsible for a
    different signal processing task, to E2E optimization using DL methods represents
    a radical paradigm shift that will entirely transform 6G and beyond wireless communications.

  zh: 人工智能有着悠久且成功的历史，可以追溯到大约1940年代，当时神经网络（[NN](#glo.acronym.nn)）首次出现在智能系统中。多年来，机器学习（[ML](#glo.acronym.ml)）和深度学习（[DL](#glo.acronym.dl)）方法已被证明是解决计算机视觉、机器人技术和自然语言处理等挑战性任务的有效框架，在这些任务中建立一个具体的数学模型相对困难。例如，尽管几乎是不可能为手写数字（数字识别）或图像中的不同对象（图像分割）开发出分析模型或鲁棒算法，但DL技术可以完成这些任务，并且其性能超过了人类水平。另一方面，通信技术依赖于大量数学模型和理论，这些模型和理论需要专业知识，如信息理论和信道建模。信息信号通过具有调制、编码和信令方案的最优发射器设计，从一系列数学定义的信道模型中可靠地传输到接收端，每个模块都经过单独优化。除了这种明确定义的PHY架构外，安全传输能力以及消除各种硬件缺陷使得通信成为一个复杂而成熟的领域。因此，ML和DL技术必须达到崇高的目标，以超越现有技术并提供显著的优势。将DL方法应用于分别优化构建模块，从调制和编码方案（[MCS](#glo.acronym.mcs)）到符号检测和信道估计算法，可能不会带来太大变化[[25](#bib.bib25)]。在复杂场景中，如未知信道模型和超高移动条件下，通信系统的端到端（[E2E](#glo.acronym.e2e)）优化是我们期待在6G中看到的最引人注目的概念，我们称之为PHY革命。从当前PHY通信的块结构（每个块负责不同的信号处理任务）转向使用DL方法的E2E优化，代表了一个彻底的范式转变，这将彻底改变6G及以后的无线通信。

    drawbacks of current systems, particularly in the past couple of years. However,
    despite being exceptionally promising, DL methods experience some difficulties
    that restrict their viability in challenging communication scenarios. The highly-parameterized
    architecture of deep NNs ([DNN](#glo.acronym.dnn) s) necessitates massive datasets
    to learn an appropriate mapping from features to desired outcomes, which increases
    the computing complexity and complicates the training process. Thus, utilizing
    solely data-based DNNs as a black box and leaving all predictions to model weights
    is questionable, at least for now, since datasets regarding communications have
    not reached a satisfactory level yet. Due to the limits of model-based and data-based
    methods, model-driven DNNs have emerged, which combine DNNs’ powerful learning
    and mapping abilities with expert knowledge to get the most potential advantage.
    The two most common model-driven DNN strategies are deep unfolded networks, where
    DNN layers replicate iterations of an existing iterative algorithm, and hybrid
    networks, where DNNs help conventional models and enhance efficiency [[26](#bib.bib26)].
    As the DL literature on communication technologies has progressed, the data scarcity
    problem has also become a thing of the past, paving the way for entirely data-based

- en: 'DL is a sub-branch of ML, with multiple stacked processing layers, that enable
    predictions, classifications, or other decisions by learning data representations.
    Given raw data, in contrast to classical ML methods that strongly depend on domain-expert
    features, DL models generate non-linear input-output mappings to execute actions
    on a goal objective. Fig. [6](#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.1 DL Architecture at a Glance
    ‣ 2 An Overview of DL Techniques ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A
    Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") illustrates the relationship
    between DL, ML, and AI. Each layer in an NN architecture transforms a representation
    to a higher level, where each transformation unlocks the learning of a more sophisticated
    characteristic of raw data. A model may be shallow or deep depending on the number
    of layers, the depth of an NN, imitating either a simplistic or complicated function
    of raw input data by being sensitive to vital features and insensitive to irrelevant
    changes such as environment or nearby objects. Aside from the input and output
    layers, each layer is a hidden layer consisting of hidden units known as neurons.
    During the representation learning process, hidden neurons in a layer calculate
    a weighted sum of their preceding layer’s inputs and transfer the result to the
    next layer through a non-linear activation function, corresponding to one iteration
    of forward-propagation. Starting with the input layer, which passes the weighted
    sum of raw input data to the first hidden layer, each hidden layer handles its
    computation. In the end, the output layer produces the desired outcomes, which
    might be probabilities, category scores, or any other metric. DL researchers have
    identified several activation functions to introduce a non-linearity effect into
    forward-propagation, such as the rectified linear unit ([ReLU](#glo.acronym.relu)),
    leaky ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, and more. The most popular one is the ReLU function
    and defined as $f(a)=\text{max}(a,0)$ [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[30](#bib.bib30)].'

    "图 6 ‣ 2.1 DL 架构概览 ‣ 2 DL 技术概述 ‣ 深度学习辅助的 6G 无线网络：革命性 PHY 架构的全面调查")展示了 DL、ML 和
    AI 之间的关系。神经网络架构中的每一层将表示转化为更高的层次，每次转化解锁了对原始数据更复杂特征的学习。模型可以是浅层或深层的，具体取决于层的数量和神经网络的深度，通过对关键特征敏感和对环境或附近物体等无关变化不敏感来模仿原始输入数据的简单或复杂函数。除了输入层和输出层外，每一层都是一个由称为神经元的隐藏单元组成的隐藏层。在表示学习过程中，隐藏层中的隐藏神经元计算其前一层输入的加权和，并通过非线性激活函数将结果传递到下一层，这对应于一次前向传播的迭代。从输入层开始，它将原始输入数据的加权和传递到第一个隐藏层，每个隐藏层处理其计算。最后，输出层产生所需的结果，这些结果可能是概率、类别得分或其他度量。DL
    研究人员已确定了几种激活函数以在前向传播中引入非线性效果，例如整流线性单元（[ReLU](#glo.acronym.relu)）、泄漏 ReLU、tanh、sigmoid

- en: 'When an NN completes a forward-propagation iteration, the algorithm computes
    a loss function by comparing the output scores with desired labels. This loss
    function represents a model error, which is subsequently utilized to update internal
    parameters, also known as model weights. The update of these adjustable weights
    corresponds to the training of the DL model. During training, the algorithm calculates
    the derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight to observe the
    amount of resultant error when weight was increased or decreased. In the opposite
    direction of forward-propagation, the algorithm computes weight gradients using
    the chain rule [[31](#bib.bib31)], which obtains derivatives going backward, called
    backpropagation. DL model updates its weights by changing them in the reverse
    direction of calculated gradients to decrease the error value after backpropagation [[29](#bib.bib29)].
    The update rule is one of the most critical aspects of DL applications since it
    highly impacts overall learning performance and training time. Thus, researchers
    have developed different optimizers, including momentum [[32](#bib.bib32)], root
    mean square propagation, stochastic gradient descent ([SGD](#glo.acronym.sgd)) [[33](#bib.bib33)],
    adaptive moment estimation ([ADAM](#glo.acronym.adam)) [[34](#bib.bib34)], and
    many more. Recently, Facebook Research has published a new update algorithm, called
    MADGRAD [[35](#bib.bib35)], and the DL world is debating whether this new technique
    can replace the ADAM optimizer. Fig. [7](#S2.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 2.1 DL Architecture
    at a Glance ‣ 2 An Overview of DL Techniques ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless
    Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") demonstrates
    a single run of a training procedure including forward-propagation, loss calculation,
    and backpropagation for a single hidden layer DNN, where the given variables will
    be defined shortly. A typical DL model takes hundreds of millions of these iterations
    to ensure that the model observes a good deal of instances and that the model
    error converges to a reasonable value depending on the application. A testing
    procedure follows training to examine whether the model can generalize to unseen
    occurrences, also known as the compositionality of DL models. The difference between
    training and test loss values represents model variance and indicates that the
    model is overfitting, in which DL model memorizes rather than learning. On the
    other hand, the difference between training and the Bayes error values corresponds
    to model bias and reveals that the model is underfitting, which necessitates more
    training. It is a common mistake to investigate model bias by comparing training
    error with zero error. Indeed, the Bayes error, the known optimal value that can
    be human-level performance or other values, should be the benchmark for bias,
    which is not necessarily zero.'

  zh: 当神经网络完成一次前向传播迭代时，算法通过将输出分数与期望标签进行比较来计算损失函数。这个损失函数表示模型错误，随后用于更新内部参数，也称为模型权重。这些可调节权重的更新对应于深度学习模型的训练。在训练过程中，算法计算损失函数相对于每个权重的导数，以观察权重增加或减少时结果误差的变化。在与前向传播相反的方向，算法使用链式法则[[31](#bib.bib31)]计算权重梯度，这个过程称为反向传播。深度学习模型通过将权重调整为计算出的梯度的反向方向来更新权重，从而在反向传播后减少误差值[[29](#bib.bib29)]。更新规则是深度学习应用中最关键的方面之一，因为它对整体学习性能和训练时间有很大影响。因此，研究人员开发了不同的优化器，包括动量优化[[32](#bib.bib32)]、均方根传播、随机梯度下降
    ([SGD](#glo.acronym.sgd))[[33](#bib.bib33)]、自适应矩估计 ([ADAM](#glo.acronym.adam))[[34](#glo.acronym.adam)]
    等。最近，Facebook Research 发布了一种新的更新算法，称为 MADGRAD [[35](#bib.bib35)]，深度学习界正在讨论这种新技术是否可以取代
    ADAM 优化器。图 [7](#S2.F7 "图 7 ‣ 2.1 深度学习架构一览 ‣ 2 深度学习技术概述 ‣ 深度学习辅助的 6G 无线网络：革命性 PHY

    architecture presumes similarity between various areas of a 2D feature vector

    The first key idea underlying the motivation of the CNN architecture is local
    connections. In contrast to DNNs, where each hidden unit links with all hidden
    units of the former and latter layers, CNNs connect a single unit in a convolutional
    layer to a local patch in the previous layer. Raw input data of a CNN model consists
    of multiple 2D feature vectors corresponding to channels. For example, a $28\times
    28$ RGB image comprises three 2D feature vectors representing the pixels in the
    RGB color channels. It is most likely that local regions of an RGB image are correlated,
    and statistics are comparable, which means a pattern appearing in an area might
    also come out of another region, such as two ears of a cat in different parts
    of an image [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[37](#bib.bib37)]. Therefore, it is logical to
    utilize these spatial relationships and link a patch of input data to a hidden
    unit rather than a fully connected structure [[37](#bib.bib37)].'

    模型的原始输入数据由多个对应于通道的 2D 特征向量组成。例如，一个 $28\times 28$ 的 RGB 图像由三个 2D 特征向量组成，表示 RGB

- en: The second major characteristic that forms the CNN baseline is weight sharing.
    Each local patch in the 2D feature vector connects to a distinct hidden unit in
    the following convolutional layer, where all links use the same weight matrix.
    The motivation behind weight sharing is to decrease the number of learnable parameters.
    The example given in [[37](#bib.bib37)] describes this motivation perfectly. Let
    us assume that we have $482\times 415$ input data with three channels, where the
    input size is $600090$. Considering the dense connection of DNNs, the parameter
    size is approximately $600$K for a single hidden unit in the next layer, increasing
    to more than $600$M for $1000$ hidden units. Many parameters increase the training
    time substantially, crack the available memory, and necessitate powerful regularizers
    to prevent overfitting. On the other hand, a $40\times 40$ shared weight matrix
    spanning local patches provides $4800$ learnable parameters, allowing $125$ hidden
    layers with $1000$ units each against a single hidden layer in the dense connection.
    As a result, the number of parameters and model size reduce significantly along
    with the enhancement of the generalization capacity, preventing memorizing data

    $482\times 415$ 的输入数据，包含三个通道，其中输入大小为 $600090$。考虑到 DNN 的密集连接，单个隐藏单元的参数大小大约为 $600$K，而
    $1000$ 个隐藏单元的参数大小则增加到超过 $600$M。许多参数会显著增加训练时间，耗尽可用内存，并且需要强大的正则化器来防止过拟合。另一方面，一个
    $40\times 40$ 的共享权重矩阵跨越局部区域，提供了 $4800$ 个可学习参数，使得 $125$ 层隐藏层每层有 $1000$ 个单元，与密集连接中的单个隐藏层相比。结果是，参数数量和模型大小显著减少，同时增强了泛化能力，防止了对数据的记忆而不是学习。

    the window of the CNN forward-propagation whose size determines the size of the

    An autoencoder is not particularly effective if it simply learns the set $\mathbf{g(f(x))=x}$

    a variety of improvements such as extremely high data rate and spectral efficiency.
    The brand new mobile communication technology, 5G, has attracted the attention
    of both academic and industrial circles with the promise of a maximum of 20 Gb/s
    peak data rate along with other major improvements in latency and energy/spectrum
    efficiency. The key enabler of a fully intelligent world, 6G, will introduce even
    higher specs such as a peak data rate of at least 1 Tb/s and a user-experienced
    data rate of 1 Gb/s [[5](#bib.bib5)]. These significant improvements are possible
    with the use of multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver sides as in
    early standards, which is known as the MIMO technology. MIMO systems can provide
    spatial diversity gain where the transmitted symbols are received from multiple
    paths and the fading effect is mitigated. Alternatively, spatial multiplexing
    gain is obtained by MIMO systems where the capacity of the channel increases linearly
    with the minimum of transmit and receive antennas [[44](#bib.bib44)]. Scaling
    up the conventional MIMO systems with a few hundred antennas that simultaneously
    serve many users, massive multi-user ([MU](#glo.acronym.mu)) MIMO technology has
    become a breakthrough. Massive MU-MIMO utilizes all the benefits of the conventional
    MIMO while eliminating the MU interference to further enhance the transmission
    performance, which can be seen in Fig. [15](#S3.F15 "Figure 15 ‣ 3 DL for Emerging
    MIMO Systems ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
    of Revolutionary PHY Architectures"). Massive MIMO provides 10 times or more capacity
    compared to the conventional MIMO via its powerful spatial multiplexing ability.
    In addition, it enhances the energy efficiency on the order of 100 times via the
    ability of sharp beamforming to the small regions with a large number of antennas [[45](#bib.bib45)].'

    Tb/s的峰值数据速率和1 Gb/s的用户体验数据速率[[5](#bib.bib5)]。这些显著的改进得益于在发射端和接收端同时使用多个天线的技术，这被称为MIMO技术。MIMO系统可以提供空间分集增益，通过多路径接收传输的符号，从而减轻衰落效应。另一种情况是，通过MIMO系统获得空间复用增益，其中通道的容量随着发射和接收天线的最小值线性增加[[44](#bib.bib44)]。通过将传统的MIMO系统扩展到同时服务许多用户的几百个天线，巨型多用户（[MU](#glo.acronym.mu)）MIMO技术已成为一种突破。巨型MU-MIMO利用传统MIMO的所有优点，同时消除MU干扰以进一步增强传输性能，这可以在图[15](#S3.F15

- en: Although massive MIMO technology brings immense benefits, it comes at some prices.
    The most shining feature of massive MIMO, spatial multiplexing, requires reliable
    channel state information ([CSI](#glo.acronym.csi)). During the downlink transmission
    of conventional MIMO systems such as in the Long Term Evolution (4G) standard,
    the base station ([BS](#glo.acronym.bs)) transmits a pilot sequence so that the
    users estimate the channel responses and feed them back to the BS. Nevertheless,
    this method is not suitable for massive MIMO systems since each user would have
    to estimate a few hundred channel responses which gives rise to a huge feedback
    overhead. Another reason is that pilots should be orthogonal between the antennas
    and this requires a considerable amount of orthogonal resources [[45](#bib.bib45)].
    Another challenge of massive MIMO technology is the number of required radio frequency
    ([RF](#glo.acronym.rf)) chains. When each transmit antenna at the BS is activated
    to transmit a different symbol, the number of required RF chains equals the number
    of transmit antennas and this increases the hardware cost. As a promising solution
    to the inherent problems of MIMO mentioned above, IM appears as a strong candidate
    for next-generation wireless communication technologies. Along with decreasing
    the need for the massive number of RF chain requirements, IM techniques provide
    high energy and spectral efficiency by conveying additional information bits utilizing
    the indices of the building blocks of a communication system [[12](#bib.bib12)].
    One of the most critical shortcomings of IM techniques is the detection complexity.
    The more bits transmitted via IM, the more complex the detector becomes. The optimum
    detector is the maximum likelihood detector ([MLD](#glo.acronym.mld)) and in some
    cases, it is impossible to use it because of its unacceptable level of complexity.
    At this point, linear detectors, such as zero-forcing ([ZF](#glo.acronym.zf))
    and minimum-mean squared error ([MMSE](#glo.acronym.mmse)) detectors, take place
    with the cost of a worse bit error rate ([BER](#glo.acronym.ber)). Thus, there
    is a trade-off between the complexity and the BER performance of currently used
    model-based detectors.

  zh: 尽管大规模MIMO技术带来了巨大的好处，但也有一些代价。大规模MIMO的最显著特性——空间复用——需要可靠的信道状态信息（[CSI](#glo.acronym.csi)）。在传统MIMO系统的下行传输中，例如在长期演进（4G）标准中，基站（[BS](#glo.acronym.bs)）会发射一个导频序列，以便用户估计信道响应并将其反馈给基站。然而，这种方法不适用于大规模MIMO系统，因为每个用户需要估计几百个信道响应，从而产生巨大的反馈开销。另一个原因是导频应在天线之间正交，这需要大量的正交资源 [[45](#bib.bib45)]。大规模MIMO技术的另一个挑战是所需的射频（[RF](#glo.acronym.rf)）链的数量。当基站的每个发射天线被激活以发射不同的符号时，所需的RF链数量等于发射天线的数量，这会增加硬件成本。作为上述MIMO固有问题的有前景的解决方案，IM技术作为下一代无线通信技术的有力候选者出现。除了减少对大量RF链的需求外，IM技术通过利用通信系统构建块的索引传输附加信息位，从而提供高能量和频谱效率 [[12](#bib.bib12)]。IM技术的一个关键缺点是检测复杂性。通过IM传输的位数越多，检测器的复杂性就越高。最佳检测器是最大似然检测器（[MLD](#glo.acronym.mld)），在某些情况下，由于其不可接受的复杂度，无法使用它。在这种情况下，线性检测器，如零强迫（[ZF](#glo.acronym.zf)）和最小均方误差（[MMSE](#glo.acronym.mmse)）检测器，将以较差的比特误码率（[BER](#glo.acronym.ber)）为代价进行应用。因此，目前使用的基于模型的检测器在复杂性和BER性能之间存在权衡。

- en: Preprocessing of transmitting signals, often known as precoding, is another
    vital topic in efficient massive MU-MIMO systems. The BS uses precoding before
    transmission to mitigate the fading channel impact and cancel MU interference.
    However, precoding techniques that currently exist in the standards require high-resolution
    digital-to-analog converters ([DAC](#glo.acronym.dac) s) which bring high complexity
    to the system. Therefore, the design of precoders with low-resolution DACs is
    of interest among the issues of intelligent massive MIMO transmitter design. Within
    the context of intelligent MIMO transmitters, another blooming topic is constellation
    design since the performance of communication systems is highly affected by the
    shape of the constellation. From their infancy to the cutting-edge technology,
    information bits are modulated by a limited number of constellations such as quadrature
    amplitude modulation ([QAM](#glo.acronym.qam)) and phase-shift keying ([PSK](#glo.acronym.psk)).
    Next-generation intelligent MIMO transmitters are expected to modulate information
    bits by using complex-shaped constellations that are optimized for the transmission
    environments. It is the mission of the intelligent black box to find the best
    locations for the constellation points and to optimize the decision boundaries
    for these points [[46](#bib.bib46)]. However, to obtain a performance improvement
    concerning the conventional constellation designs, the receiver must be aware
    of the decision boundaries of the used complex-shaped constellations. Therefore,
    it is mission impossible for the conventional detectors to decode information
    bits without the initial knowledge of the constellation design. This is where
    E2E learning appears as one of the remarkably charming concepts for the next-generation
    wireless communication systems, where the aim is to fully optimize both the transmitter
    and receiver by representing the whole system as an autoencoder ([AE](#glo.acronym.ae)) [[47](#bib.bib47)].

  zh: 传输信号的预处理，通常称为预编码，是高效大规模MU-MIMO系统中的另一个重要话题。基站在传输前使用预编码来减轻衰落信道的影响并取消MU干扰。然而，目前标准中存在的预编码技术需要高分辨率的数模转换器（[DAC](#glo.acronym.dac)），这为系统带来了高复杂度。因此，设计具有低分辨率DAC的预编码器在智能大规模MIMO发射机设计问题中备受关注。在智能MIMO发射机的背景下，另一个蓬勃发展的主题是星座设计，因为通信系统的性能受到星座形状的高度影响。从早期到前沿技术，信息比特通过有限数量的星座进行调制，如正交振幅调制（[QAM](#glo.acronym.qam)）和相位键控（[PSK](#glo.acronym.psk)）。下一代智能MIMO发射机预计将使用优化的复杂形状星座调制信息比特，以适应传输环境。智能黑箱的使命是找到星座点的最佳位置并优化这些点的决策边界[[46](#bib.bib46)]。然而，为了在传统星座设计的基础上获得性能改进，接收机必须了解使用的复杂形状星座的决策边界。因此，对于传统检测器来说，在没有星座设计初始知识的情况下解码信息比特几乎是不可能的。这就是E2E学习成为下一代无线通信系统中一种极具魅力的概念的原因，其目标是通过将整个系统表示为自编码器（[AE](#glo.acronym.ae)）来全面优化发射机和接收机[[47](#bib.bib47)]。

- en: The primary motivation behind using DL techniques in MIMO detectors is to overcome
    the trade-off between computational complexity and BER performance. The MLD operates
    depending on a strong mathematical model and it is proved that MLD provides the
    optimum BER performance under ideal conditions [[48](#bib.bib48), [49](#bib.bib49)].
    Since DL techniques, especially DNNs, are general function approximators, the
    model of the MLD can be represented by NNs with significantly low complexity.
    These approximations are not expected to outperform MLD. Instead, it is expected
    to reach the performance of MLD without requiring the impractical complexity of
    MLD. In what follows, we reveal and summarize a brief overview of the literature

- en: As discussed earlier, DL-based detectors are expected to decrease the complexity
    in MIMO system models with IM techniques. Within this context, data-driven and
    model-driven DNNs are investigated in [[48](#bib.bib48)] and [[49](#bib.bib49)],
    respectively. Instead of a single giant DNN, the work in [[48](#bib.bib48)] suggests
    utilizing data-driven sub-DNNs for the detection process of a MIMO system with
    generalized spatial modulation ([GSM](#glo.acronym.gsm)). The proposed architecture
    performs similarly to the MLD and the single DNN detector with lower complexity
    under the assumption that the fading channel is fixed and the noise is independent
    and identically distributed ([i.i.d.](#glo.acronym.iid)) Gaussian. However, when
    the noise is correlated or has a deviation in its distribution, the sub-DNN architecture
    outperforms the MLD and the single DNN detector. CSI at the receiver is not necessary
    for fixed fading channels, but it is essential for time-varying channels. On the
    other hand, in [[49](#bib.bib49)], the authors propose a model-driven DL-based
    block detector for GSM inspired by linear block detectors such as Block-ZF and
    Block-MMSE detectors. The APM symbol of each active transmit antenna is detected
    by a DNN, assuming that perfect CSI is available at the receiver. The B-DNN model
    outperforms the linear detectors and performs similarly to the MLD with lower
    complexity.

- en: The treatises examined so far follow the fundamental principle of DNNs, which
    is stacking the hidden layers to build a deep network and to increase the learning
    ability. However, the authors in [[55](#bib.bib55)] realize that deepening the
    network after a certain number of hidden layers does not considerably improve
    the BER performance. Therefore, they propose a parallel detection network, where
    several DL detection networks perform in parallel to introduce a diversity effect.
    In order to obtain diversity, a special loss function is designed. Detection is
    carried out based on the perfect knowledge of the CSI. Likewise, in [[56](#bib.bib56)],
    a DL-based detector composed of many parallel modified DNNs introduces a diversity
    gain in a MIMO system model. The modified DNNs employ the residual learning principle
    and differ in several ways and introduce diversity to the system. Assuming perfect

    MMSE, and single DNN-based detectors.

- en: The kind of NN employed in DL-based detectors is another key factor that draws
    attention. Within this perspective, the work in [[57](#bib.bib57)] compares DNN-
    and CNN-based detectors to address the issues of robust detection with imperfect
    CSI and efficient DL framework for low-complex detection. This comparison reveals
    that the DNN-based detector performs significantly better in terms of the BER
    performance. In addition, it outperforms the ZF, MMSE, and DetNet [[50](#bib.bib50)], [[51](#bib.bib51)]
    detectors with both perfect and imperfect CSI at the receiver. However, the MLD
    detector has a considerably better BER performance than the proposed detector.
    With a similar approach, DNN-, CNN-, and RNN-based detectors are designed without
    channel dependency and compared to the MLD in [[58](#bib.bib58)]. Computer simulations
    in this study show that the RNN-based approach performs the best, whereas the
    DNN-based approach is the poorest. The fact that DNN-based architecture outperforms
    CNN-based architecture in [[57](#bib.bib57)] but degrades in [[58](#bib.bib58)]
    demonstrates that the optimum DL architecture is dependent on the system model

- en: So far, the suggested detectors have relied on channel assumptions without considering
    real-world conditions. However, according to [[59](#bib.bib59)] and [[60](#bib.bib60)],
    the main issue with the existing DL-based detectors is either unpleasant performance
    over practical spatially correlated channels or a computational burden because
    of retraining for each channel realization. Thus, the authors of [[59](#bib.bib59)]
    focus on a robust DL-based MIMO detector that can optimize itself via online training
    during the transmission over realistic and spatially correlated channel models.
    The proposed detector, called MMNet, is built upon iterative soft-thresholding
    algorithms. Experiments conducted by using a dataset of channel realizations from
    the 3GPP 3D MIMO channel indicate that MMNet outperforms the classical approaches
    such as AMP and SDRX, as well as recent DL techniques like DetNet [[50](#bib.bib50)], [[51](#bib.bib51)],
    and OAMPNet [[52](#bib.bib52)], under the assumption of perfect CSI. The work
    in [[60](#bib.bib60)] introduces an additional NN, a HyperNetwork, that eliminates
    the need for online retraining on top of a modified version of MMNet to create
    the HyperMIMO detector. Computer simulation results reveal that the HyperMIMO
    detector outperforms MMSE and OAMPNet [[52](#bib.bib52)] and performs similarly
    to the MMNet and the MLD with less computing cost under the perfect CSI.

- en: Channel estimation in mmWave massive MIMO systems is complicated since the number
    of RF chains is limited. The authors of [[70](#bib.bib70)] propose a learned denoising-based
    AMP ([LDAMP](#glo.acronym.ldamp)) network to solve this problem. The LDAMP network
    is an image recovery network that treats the channel matrix as a 2D image, with
    a single pilot for all channels in the antenna array. The LDAMP network outperforms
    the conventional AMP variants. The study in [[71](#bib.bib71)] focuses on DNN-based
    direction-of-arrival ([DOA](#glo.acronym.doa)) estimation in addition to DNN-based
    channel estimation. Specifically, two DNN-based algorithms operate DOA and channel
    estimation processes without the need for pilot symbols. Extensive computer simulations
    verify that the suggested DOA and channel estimation algorithms exceed the traditional
    techniques in terms of mean squared error ([MSE](#glo.acronym.mse)) of DOA and
    BER performance. Motivated by the drawbacks of [[70](#bib.bib70)], the authors
    of [[72](#bib.bib72)] develop a better denoising network based on CNNs along with
    the LDAMP network, resulting in the fully convolutional denoising AMP algorithm.
    The required pilot length is less than the number of channel components to be
    estimated. The fully convolutional denoising AMP algorithm has a successive performance
    over LDAMP [[70](#bib.bib70)] and other variants of AMP in terms of both normalized
    MSE ([NMSE](#glo.acronym.nmse)) and achievable sum rate. Another channel estimator
    built upon the classical learned AMP ([LAMP](#glo.acronym.lamp)) method is presented

    stage of the Gaussian mixture LAMP algorithm, a new shrinkage function is developed
    based on the Gaussian mixture distribution of beamspace channel elements. Then,
    the Gaussian mixture LAMP-based beamspace channel estimation is performed depending
    on the derived shrinkage function in the second stage. The proposed algorithm

    with mixed-resolution ADCs implements channel estimation with DNNs. A direct-input
    DNN estimates channels using the received signals of all antennas, whereas a selective-input
    prediction DNN estimates channels of the antennas with low-resolution ADCs via
    received signals of the antennas with high-resolution ADCs. The proposed algorithm
    has a superior performance over the classical MMSE and the expectation-maximization
    Gaussian-mixture generalized AMP methods. The idea of using mixed-resolution ADCs
    is improved in [[77](#bib.bib77)], where the authors propose an optimization technique

    MIMO systems. The pilot signal is divided into segments in the first stage, where
    each one forms the input of a DNN. The estimated channel is the average of all
    DNNs’ outputs. Next, detected data symbols using the initial estimation are interpreted
    as the remaining pilot signals and utilized to update the initial channel estimation,
    similar to the procedure in [[67](#bib.bib67)]. The proposed algorithm surpasses
    the traditional LS and Bussgang linear MMSE algorithms in terms of MSE under both
    i.i.d. and spatially correlated channels. Similarly, the work in [[79](#bib.bib79)]
    proposes a DNN-based channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO systems. The authors
    perform investigations to determine the length and architecture of the pilot sequence
    required to ensure that the quantized received signals are mapped to the channel
    matrix. According to these analyses, the more BS antennas, the better the channel
    estimation performance for the same pilot length. Equivalently, the more BS antennas,
    the less required pilot length for the same channel estimation performance. The
    suggested network outclasses the GAMP algorithm under the indoor massive MIMO
    channel scenario offered by [[74](#bib.bib74)] and [[75](#bib.bib75)]. As opposed
    to the former one-bit channel estimators, [[80](#bib.bib80)] introduces a conditional
    generative adversarial network ([GAN](#glo.acronym.gan)) that can learn an adaptive
    loss function to optimize the training procedure and predict the channels. The

    GAMP algorithm, two-stage algorithm [[67](#bib.bib67)], LDAMP, channel and DOA

    motivation of using fewer pilots for DL-based channel estimators. It is also encouraging
    to note that realistic channel scenarios are becoming increasingly common, albeit
    still insufficiently so, within the framework of DL-based channel estimators.

    systems. In [[86](#bib.bib86)], a single DNN jointly executes channel estimation

- en: The authors of [[87](#bib.bib87)] direct their research towards intelligent
    receiver for spatial modulation ([SM](#glo.acronym.sm)) considering time-variant
    dynamic channels. The suggested network, called DeepSM, consists of two parallel
    DNNs, with the upper DNN updating the CSI and the lower one detecting the transmitted
    symbols at each time slot. The initial CSI is computed using the LS technique
    utilizing a pilot signal with a length equal to the number of transmit antennas.
    DeepSM is compared to the conventional model-based and data-driven DNN-based receivers
    over both time-variant and time-invariant channel models. Both benchmarks implement
    LS channel estimation and assume that the channel is invariant during the whole
    simulation. Subsequently, the conventional model-based receiver employs MLD detection,
    whereas the data-driven DNN-based receiver detects the transmitted symbols by
    a DNN. Extensive computer simulations reveal that DeepSM outperforms the benchmark
    schemes in all scenarios. Similar to the iterative architecture of DeepSM, the
    work in [[88](#bib.bib88)] proposes a model-driven DL-based joint channel estimation
    and symbol detection network, OAMP-Net2, by unfolding the existing iterative algorithm
    OAMP. OAMP-Net2 performs initial pilot-based channel estimation and detects information
    symbols afterward. Following that, data-aided channel estimation and symbol detection
    processes take place iteratively. The recommended approach outperforms the AMP,
    OAMP, MMSE, MMSE-SIC, DetNet [[50](#bib.bib50)], [[51](#bib.bib51)], and OAMP-Net [[52](#bib.bib52)]
    in different MIMO setups and modulation orders. MLD and SPD detectors, on the
    other hand, outclass OAMP-Net2 with their significantly larger complexity. In
    addition, OAMP-Net2 is specifically compared with OAMP-Net [[52](#bib.bib52)]
    in various MIMO setups and modulation orders considering both i.i.d. and correlated
    channel scenarios, in which OAMP-Net2 beats the predecessor in all situations.
    Furthermore, the authors examine OAMP-Net2 under the practical Quadriga 3GPP 3D

    uplink MU-MIMO systems. The first technique, FullCon, is a data-driven DNN-based
    algorithm and detects the information bits by the received signal directly without
    explicitly executing channel estimation. MdNet, on the other hand, separates the
    channel estimation and symbol detection phases. DNN-based channel estimation follows
    the LS estimation in the first stage, while the DL-based detector comes after
    ZF detection in the second stage. Both receiver algorithms are tested using various
    MIMO configurations and the number of hidden layers and neurons inside the layers.
    In addition, they are compared to two conventional receiver structures first of
    which consists of LS channel estimation and MMSE detection, while the second one
    includes LS channel estimation and projected gradient iterative detection. According
    to computer simulation results, both FullCon and MdNet outperform traditional
    techniques in $2\times 2$ and $4\times 4$ MIMO setups. One notable outcome of
    computer simulations is that FullCon has superior performance than MdNet in $2\times

    includes the geometry of the surroundings as well as the transmitter and receiver

    for vision-aided wireless communications based on the 3D modeling and ray-tracing

    wireless data, with visual data, such as that collected from LiDAR (light detection

    revolution with fully intelligent frameworks. Therefore, we will investigate DL
    approaches that optimize individual blocks of a MIMO transmitter and eventually

    be trained as an AE to address the conventional block structure’s sub-optimization

    MIMO 发射机各个模块的 DL 方法，并最终学习一个与相应接收机架构调谐的完整发射机框架。E2E 通信的基本思想是用一个可以作为 AE 训练的单一 DL
    网络替代 MIMO 发射机、信道和接收机的各个独立模块，以解决传统模块结构的次优化问题[[25](#bib.bib25)]，[ [94](#bib.bib94)]。作为出发点，我们将首先深入探讨基于
    DL 的星座设计的细节。
- en: As previously mentioned, constructing constellations with the aid of DL networks
    is an E2E process since the network must optimize both the positions and decision
    regions of the constellation points. The objective is to maximize the mutual information
    between the input and output of the channel, even when the channel model is unknown [[46](#bib.bib46)].
    The study in [[95](#bib.bib95)] provides an AE for designing optimal constellations
    and receiver architectures for additive white Gaussian noise ([AWGN](#glo.acronym.awgn))
    channels with additive radar interference. The optimization metric is mutual information.
    Under various channel model assumptions for different SNR regimes, several demapping
    procedures are suggested. In addition, the proposed network enables using powerful
    coding methods such as turbo codes or low-density parity-check ([LDPC](#glo.acronym.ldpc))
    codes. Computer simulations reveal that the AE-based network outperforms the architectures
    with the traditional constellations. The network in [[96](#bib.bib96)] conducts
    probabilistic shaping to improve the constellations along with the geometric shaping.
    The probabilistic shaping optimizes the probability of occurrence of the constellation
    points. Even when the geometry of the constellation is fixed, such as QAM, the
    probabilistic shaping improves the achievable information rate. This network also
    maximizes mutual information using AEs, as in [[95](#bib.bib95)]. The proposed
    joint shaping method achieves near-capacity performance and outperforms both non-shaped
    QAM and just geometric-shaped QAM across AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. [[97](#bib.bib97)]
    analyzes AE-based constellation design over a MU interference channel to address
    the dynamic interference problem. Specifically, the adaptive DL-based AE network
    can learn the degree of interference and enhance BER performance by adjusting
    each user’s constellation accordingly. According to computer simulations, users’
    learned constellations are well-decomposed, and they concentrate on their clusters
    in the face of heavy interference. It is, therefore, much easier for the receiver
    to decode the information in the strong-interference environment. Furthermore,
    the AE-based network performs very similar to the typical uncoded binary PSK ([BPSK](#glo.acronym.bpsk))
    and quadrature PSK ([QPSK](#glo.acronym.qpsk)), with around 2 dB improvement over
    8-PSK and 16-QAM.

- en: Along with intelligent constellation designs that are more resilient to dynamic
    propagation environments than the traditional fixed constellations, DL-based approaches
    have also been applied to precoding in massive MIMO transmitters. The goal is
    to use DL networks to offer reliable precoding with low-resolution DACs while
    substantially decreasing complexity. The study in [[99](#bib.bib99)] investigates
    a one-bit precoding design with the optimum constellation design utilizing AEs.
    In a multicast massive MU-MIMO system where the BS broadcasts the information
    signal to all users, the transmitter composes a DNN followed by a binary layer
    to satisfy the one-bit precoding constraint. Because the gradients of the binary
    layer are always zero, implementing the standard backpropagation approach is complicated.
    Therefore, the authors employ an approximation which is a variant of the straight-through
    estimator. Experiments over fixed and varying channels show that the AE-based
    one-bit precoding and constellation design network outperforms the PSK and QAM
    transmissions with the conventional one-bit precoder [[100](#bib.bib100)]. It
    is also worth noting that the performance of the AE-based constellation design
    with the standard one-bit precoder [[100](#bib.bib100)] is the best, demonstrating
    the potential of model-driven DL networks. Likewise, [[101](#bib.bib101)] provides
    AE-based symbol-level precoding ([SLP](#glo.acronym.slp)) and constellation design
    for unicast massive MU-MIMO systems in which the BS transmits a unique information
    signal to each user. Moreover, the authors examine robust SLP design for classic
    QAM constellations in instances when AE-based constellations are challenging to
    execute in reality. According to the numerical results, the proposed AE-based
    SLP and constellation design network outperforms the AE-based SLP with QAM constellation
    and non-robust SLP with QAM constellation. Another DL-based SLP design is provided
    in [[102](#bib.bib102)], where the authors propose an efficient precoding NN to
    mitigate MU interference in an MU-MISO system model. The optimization metric is
    the minimum quality-of-service of all users. Simulation results illustrate that
    the suggested network has superior performance than the conventional block-level
    precoding. However, the traditional convex optimized SLP scheme beats the recommended
    network with considerably greater complexity, indicating that the DL-based SLP
    network provides robust performance with significantly reduced complexity. The
    work in [[103](#bib.bib103)] is similar to [[99](#bib.bib99)] and [[101](#bib.bib101)]
    in that it offers an AE-based precoding network for MIMO systems. The transmitter
    consists of two DNNs that encode bits to symbols and precode these symbols with
    power normalization at the end. As seen from computer simulations, the AE-based
    precoding network surpasses the conventional linear precoding techniques such
    as ZF and MMSE and the non-linear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding assuming perfect
    CSI. The authors of [[104](#bib.bib104)] present a similar separate DNN structure
    of [[103](#bib.bib103)] in the MIMO transmitter. The first of the two DNNs encodes
    bits to symbols, while the second does precoding. The receiver of this AE-based
    approach includes a radio transformer network ([RTN](#glo.acronym.rtn)). The precoding
    network at the transmitter and the RTN at the receiver are trained in an E2E fashion
    to outclass the classical DL-based MIMO system. Simulations with different MIMO
    configurations reveal that the proposed combined precoding and RTN architecture
    outperforms the traditional linear precoding methods ZF and MMSE and the DL structures
    with only precoding or RTN. The authors also thoroughly analyze the precoding
    network’s learned constellations.

    with a uniform planar array at the BS. The objective of this framework is to implement
    precoding that maximizes the ergodic rate while limiting overall transmit power
    under a constraint by using both instantaneous and statistical CSI. The authors,
    however, convert this ergodic rate maximization issue to an enhanced quality-of-service
    problem to make it tractable, and the structure of optimum precoding emerges as

    the proposed framework reduces complexity significantly while maintaining almost

    DL-based networks are also popular within the context of precoding design by combining
    the conventional algorithms with DL techniques. The work in [[110](#bib.bib110)]
    optimizes the conventional non-linear biconvex 1-bit precoding ([C2PO](#glo.acronym.c2po))
    method by automatically tuning the algorithm parameters in a massive MU-MIMO system
    model. The NN optimized C2PO ([NNO-C2PO](#glo.acronym.nno-c2po)) unfolds the iterations
    of C2PO and utilizes backpropagation to adjust parameters. Simulations conducted
    using the Quadriga channel model [[84](#bib.bib84)], [[85](#bib.bib85)] illustrate
    that the proposed NNO-C2PO algorithm requires about 50% fewer iterations than
    C2PO for a similar BER performance. In addition, NNO-C2PO may employ the same
    parameters learned for a given channel model for various channel models with a
    moderate performance loss, indicating robustness to dynamic channel circumstances.
    In like manner, the study in [[111](#bib.bib111)] unfolds another conventional
    iterative algorithm named iterative discrete estimation ([IDE2](#glo.acronym.ide2))
    to develop a model-driven DL network for massive MU-MIMO with finite-alphabet
    precoding. The proposed network, IDE2-Net, precodes the transmit signals using
    low-resolution DACs by modifying the current IDE2 algorithm with configurable
    parameters. Simulations reveal that IDE2-Net has substantially better performance
    than the IDE2 algorithm and slightly outperforms NNO-C2PO [[110](#bib.bib110)]
    for the same number of iterations. Following in the footsteps of the formers,
    the authors unfold the classical iterative conjugate gradient method for constant
    envelope precoding in [[112](#bib.bib112)]. The suggested network, CEPNet, optimizes
    the traditional approach by introducing trainable parameters to decrease MU interference
    and computational cost. Simulations show that CEPNet significantly outperforms
    the conventional algorithm in terms of both BER and average achievable rate performances
    with less complexity. CEPNet is also resistant to channel estimation errors and
    channel model mismatch as in [[110](#bib.bib110)]. The study in [[113](#bib.bib113)]

    a layer-wise structure to maximize the sum rate. The proposed network embeds trainable
    parameters to the WMMSE algorithm to eliminate matrix inversions and reduce complexity.
    Unlike previous studies, the authors develop a CNN-based precoding scheme to compare
    their model-driven method to a data-driven network. Extensive simulation results
    in a massive MU-MIMO system model with varying numbers of transmit antennas and
    users show that the proposed method reaches the sum rate of the WMMSE algorithm
    and outperforms the CNN-based scheme with much less complexity. By unfolding,
    another conventional iterative technique, the alternate direction method of multipliers
    ([ADMM](#glo.acronym.admm)), is mapped to a DL framework in [[114](#bib.bib114)].
    The authors provide ADMM-Net for large-scale mmWave communications in which the
    DL-based SLP selects the optimum subset of RF chains to decrease power consumption.

    study in this area, which is given in [[25](#bib.bib25)], analyzes an E2E network
    for a given channel model and a loss function. This comprehensive research includes
    various investigations. First, the AE-based E2E network is compared against an
    uncoded BPSK scheme at several coding rates, with the proposed network outperforming

    of an AE-based E2E network in an interference channel. Comparison against a time-sharing
    scheme reveals substantial gains. In addition, a CNN-based DL network yields promising
    performance within the context of modulation classification and outperforms the
    expert feature approaches. This exhaustive treatise opens the door for our ultimate
    goal of PHY revolution. The authors of [[125](#bib.bib125)] apply this innovative
    E2E technique to MIMO system models and investigate the performance of AEs across
    Rayleigh fading channels for various MIMO configurations. In the first case, an
    AE optimizes its encoding scheme during training to introduce spatial diversity
    in a $2\times 1$ MIMO setup. Compared to the well-known Alamouti coding, the AE
    creates a superior encoding scheme without CSI at the transmitter, as demonstrated
    in simulations, where the AE achieves slightly higher diversity in two time slots.
    This improvement is the consequence of the uneven distribution of power across
    antennas. In the second case, another AE is trained to obtain spatial multiplexing

    numerous examinations for E2E communication systems. The principal motivation
    is to switch from symbol-wise AE to bit-wise AE for the first time in the literature
    to show that optimizing bit metrics improves the overall performance. Bit-wise
    AE with IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4) LDPC code outperforms the symbol-wise AE with IEEE
    802.11n LDPC code and the conventional communication using PSK or QAM. Also, the

    separation in the constellation, which is a solid indicator of performance improvement.
    The authors further enhance the BER performance by replacing the demapper of the
    model with the iterative demapping and decoding scheme, which results in a superior
    BER performance compared to the bit-wise AE without iterative demapping and decoding
    at the receiver. In addition, they optimize the LDPC codes used in iterative demapping
    and decoding-aided bit-wise AE and obtain enhancement in the BER performance.
    Although the AWGN channel is assumed in computer simulations, the strength of
    the proposed technique is its flexibility to be applied to any channel model without
    modification, as demonstrated by simulations utilizing software-defined radio
    ([SDR](#glo.acronym.sdr)). The study in [[129](#bib.bib129)] investigates a solution
    to the problem of finding $(n,k)$ block codes to maximize the minimum Hamming
    distance between the codewords by using AEs. Along with a custom loss function,
    the authors suggest two receiver structures depending on DNN and bidirectional
    RNN. The proposed model performs almost the same as the optimal block codes in
    the AWGN channel, and the minimum Hamming distance learned by the AE achieves
    its optimal value specified in theory. In addition, AE-based block code outperforms
    the theoretical optimum under channel model mismatches in which the performance

    Dynamically switching between these codebooks according to DNN-based SER predictions

    systems by combining the benefits of SM and MIMO. Reducing the number of required
    RF chains by activating only a subset of the transmit antennas, GSM has lower
    complexity than conventional MIMO. It also improves SM efficiency by activating
    more transmit antennas and conveying more information bits. However, when the
    number of transmit antenna combinations and information bits increases, the complexity
    of MLD detection escalates to intolerable levels, as discussed earlier. On the
    other hand, linear detectors, such as ZF and MMSE detectors, produce significantly
    worse BER performance than MLD, introducing a trade-off into GSM systems. To address
    this BER-complexity trade-off, the authors of [[49](#bib.bib49)] suggest a DNN-based
    detector for GSM systems. They consider a GSM system model with $N_{t}$ transmit
    and $N_{r}$ receive antennas $(N_{r}<N_{t})$, where $N_{p}$ $(2\leq N_{p}\ll N_{t})$
    out of $N_{t}$ transmit antennas are selected by index bits to be activated in
    any time slot. There are $N=2^{\lfloor\text{log}_{2}\binom{N_{t}}{N_{p}}\rfloor}$
    legitimate transmit antenna combinations ([TAC](#glo.acronym.tac)), where each
    active antenna transmits a symbol from normalized $M$-QAM constellation $\mathcal{S}$.
    Thus, the total number of bits transmitted in each time slot equals $B=\text{log}_{2}N+N_{p}\text{log}_{2}M$.

    input feature vector $\mathbf{d}_{i}$ of the feed-forward DNN by processing the
    raw data composed of the received signal vector $\mathbf{y}$ and the channel matrix
    $\mathbf{H}_{I}$ corresponding to the $i^{\text{th}}$ legitimate TAC. As described
    in [[130](#bib.bib130)], the selected FVG type significantly impacts model performance,
    and the joint FVG results in the best performance among the other FVG types for
    the model suggested in [[130](#bib.bib130)]. Hence, the authors of [[49](#bib.bib49)]
    explore the influence of FVG type on detection reliability and evaluate the BER
    performance of the block-DNN detector for three FVG kinds described in [[130](#bib.bib130)]:
    separate FVG, joint FVG, and conventional FVG. Combining the feature vectors of
    all legitimate TACs, the FVG creates the feature matrix $\mathbf{D}$ and feeds
    it to the feed-forward DNN. In the second stage, the DNN yields a $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{I}$
    for each $\mathbf{d}_{i}$. The feed-forward DNN contains $N_{p}$ sub-DNNs to estimate
    the QAM symbol corresponding to each active transmit antenna. Finally, the block-DNN
    detector employs ([13](#S3.E13 "In 3.6 MIMO-DL in Action ‣ 3 DL for Emerging MIMO
    Systems ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of
    Revolutionary PHY Architectures")) to obtain the selected TAC and QAM symbols.
    We reproduce some of the figures in [[49](#bib.bib49)] using the network and training
    parameters given in Table [4](#S3.T4 "Table 4 ‣ 3.6 MIMO-DL in Action ‣ 3 DL for
    Emerging MIMO Systems ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive
    Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") and share some portion of example
    codes. The training procedure of any block-DNN detector ignores the GSM scheme
    at the transmitter, assuming all transmit antennas are active, which makes sense
    since DNN is only responsible for detecting QAM symbols given a TAC. In addition,
    the received signal does not experience AWGN during the training. Here is an example
    model creation of a DNN with separate FVG for QPSK transmission, which is another
    version of model definition in Keras different than what we provided in Section
    II-B:'

- en: Waveform, which characterizes the physical shape of information-carrying signals,
    is one of the key components of wireless communication systems [[20](#bib.bib20)].
    Existing waveforms can be categorized into two groups as single-carrier (SC) and
    MC waveforms. In order to increase the data rate in a SC or MC system, symbol
    duration needs to be decreased or equivalently bandwidth occupied for data transmission
    should be increased. However, with the adoption of wider bandwidth, SC waveforms
    suffer from frequency-selective fading that causes inter-symbol interference (ISI)
    since symbol duration is less than the delay spread of the wireless channel. Since
    complex equalization techniques should be applied to reduce ISI, it is very challenging
    to provide high data rates with the existing SC waveforms. In an MC system, the
    frequency band is divided into many sub-bands which are also known as subcarriers [[142](#bib.bib142)].
    These subcarriers are employed in parallel to convey information bits simultaneously.
    The spacing between two consecutive subcarriers is selected such that each of
    them undergoes flat fading in the frequency domain. Hence, a simple single-tap
    equalizer may be utilized to remove the channel effect in MC systems. Consequently,
    MC techniques enable wideband transmission to convey information; therefore, they
    yield higher data rates than SC techniques.

- en: OFDM appears as the most popular MC waveform and has been used in numerous standards
    such as LTE and the IEEE 802.11 family due to its simple and effective structure.
    Owing to the overlapped orthogonal subcarriers, OFDM is capable of using the spectrum
    efficiently. Moreover, the time frequency grid of OFDM allows the flexible use
    of resource elements. In conventional OFDM systems, modulated data symbols for
    each data subcarrier are determined in the frequency domain by mapping information
    bits to the PSK/QAM constellation. A certain number of subcarriers are allocated
    for the transmission of pilot symbols in order to perform channel estimation at
    the receiver side. These pilot symbols can be inserted into the OFDM symbol with
    block or comb type methods [[143](#bib.bib143)]. Channel coefficients can be estimated
    in the time-domain or frequency-domain and numerous estimation techniques, which
    provide different performance and complexity, have been proposed for these two
    domains [[144](#bib.bib144), [145](#bib.bib145)]. In the frequency domain, the
    channel frequency response is estimated by exploiting pilot symbols and is interpolated
    to obtain the channel frequency response over data symbols. For example, the least
    squares (LS) and the linear minimum mean error square ([LMMSE](#glo.acronym.lmmse))
    are two well-known frequency domain channel estimation methods. After inserting
    pilot symbols, the time domain OFDM signal is obtained by employing the inverse
    fast Fourier transform ([IFFT](#glo.acronym.ifft)). Furthermore, a CP is embedded
    in the beginning or end of the OFDM symbol to eliminate ISI. Additionally, the
    CP allows us to model the frequency selective channel as circular convolution.
    After adding a CP, the OFDM signal is transmitted through the wireless communication
    channel. At the receiver side, the CP is removed and the frequency domain OFDM
    signal is acquired by taking FFT. Channel estimation is performed and equalization
    is applied to remove the effect of the wireless channel. Finally, the signal is
    demodulated to obtain information.

    such as high PAPR, sensitivity to frequency and timing errors, high out-of-band
    emissions ([OOBE](#glo.acronym.oobe)), and CP&pilot overhead. After IFFT operation,
    the subcarriers are randomly summed up in the time domain and this may cause high
    peaks due to the overlapping of the peak amplitudes of different signals. The
    power amplifier at the transmitter works in the nonlinear region due to these
    high peaks, generating distortion and spectral dispersion. These peaks give rise
    to high PAPR that reduces the efficiency of the power amplifier, analog-to-digital,
    and digital-to-analog converters. Therefore, researchers have designed various
    PAPR reduction techniques for OFDM transmission systems [[146](#bib.bib146)].
    Another drawback of OFDM is sensitivity to intercarrier interference ([ICI](#glo.acronym.ici))
    caused by high mobility, phase noise, timing offset, and carrier frequency offset
    (CFO). The channel in a mobile wireless environment rapidly changes with respect
    to time. This places a strain on the receiver since it must precisely estimate
    the channel prior to coherent detection. The most critical consequence of this
    time variation is the distortion of the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting
    in ICI, whose intensity is determined by the amount of channel time variation.
    Furthermore, ICI may also occur due to the frequency difference between the local
    oscillators of the transmitter and receiver. Since ICI disrupts OFDM subcarriers,
    data detection becomes less accurate, and a single tap equalizer can not provide
    satisfactory performance. Thus, more complicated methods are required to decode
    OFDM symbols. To combat this difficult interference mitigation problem under high
    mobility environments or in the presence of CFO, several decoding algorithms have
    been proposed [[147](#bib.bib147)]. Another important concern with OFDM systems
    is their excessive out-of-band emissions (OOBE) that should be diminished to prevent
    adjacent channel interference. The OFDM signal has a rectangular pulse in the
    time domain, which generates a sinc signal in the frequency domain. The sidelobes
    of the sinc signals at the edge carriers bring tremendous interference; therefore,
    they should be minimized. OOBE decreases through various windowing/filtering methods
    together with guard band allocation to fulfill the spectrum mask criteria of the
    different standards. Nonetheless, spectral efficiency degrades due to the fixed
    guard band allocation. Lastly, in OFDM systems, inserting CP and pilot symbols
    is highly indispensable. However, the spectral efficiency reduces because of reserving
    a considerable number of resources for CP and pilot overhead.

- en: In recent years, many different and attractive OFDM-based MC waveforms have
    been designed to alleviate the drawbacks of OFDM. Windowed-OFDM ([W-OFDM](#glo.acronym.w-ofdm))
    has been proposed to reduce OOBE by applying windowing operation to classical
    OFDM. Filter bank MC ([FBMC](#glo.acronym.fbmc)) [[148](#bib.bib148)], which implements
    subcarrier-wise filtering operation, has been introduced. FBMC can use the spectrum
    more efficiently and is more resilient under high mobility compared to OFDM in
    the expense of additional signal processing. Generalized frequency division multiplexing
    ([GFDM](#glo.acronym.gfdm)) [[149](#bib.bib149)], which also performs filtering
    at the subcarrier level like FBMC, appears as a remarkably flexible waveform since
    it does not have to meet the orthogonality requirement. Another engaging waveform
    is universal filtered MC ([UFMC](#glo.acronym.ufmc)) that applies filtering to
    subbands instead of subcarriers [[150](#bib.bib150)]. UFMC needs less redundancy
    in comparison to FBMC; however, it is not applicable for very high data rates.
    As mentioned previously, since the orthogonality of its subcarriers is disrupted,
    OFDM is highly susceptible to high Doppler which leads to ICI. Orthogonal time
    frequency space ([OTFS](#glo.acronym.otfs)) modulation appears as a promising
    waveform that brings a clever solution to this disadvantage of OFDM [[151](#bib.bib151)].
    Even in high-Doppler channels, OTFS assures that each transmitted symbol has a
    near-constant channel gain by converting the time-varying multipath channel into
    a two-dimensional delay-Doppler channel. Finally, OFDM with IM ([OFDM-IM](#glo.acronym.ofdm-im))
    emerges as a promising OFDM-based waveform that changes only the modulation/demodulation
    processes of plain OFDM system and offers an additional degree of freedom for
    waveform design thanks to the flexibility of IM [[152](#bib.bib152)]. It is clear
    that all waveforms mentioned above have both some advantages and disadvantages
    over OFDM. Because of its simple structure, OFDM was chosen for also 5G networks,
    and we believe that it will maintain its importance for future wireless systems.

    receiver and transceiver designs, that is the studies that focus on the joint
    optimization of both transmitter and receiver structures, is provided. For the
    receiver design, most studies mainly focus on the implementation of DL-based techniques
    for channel estimation and symbol detection. For the transceiver design, the processing
    blocks at the transmitter and receiver are devised together by using AE-based
    approaches to optimize the system as a whole.

- en: DL has been implemented for channel estimation and symbol detection in an OFDM
    system for the first time in [[153](#bib.bib153)]. In this study, DNNs have been
    shown to be capable of learning and evaluating wireless channel properties. The
    proposed DNN architecture, which is trained with the simulated OFDM symbols, has
    been designed as data-driven and fully-connected. When the number of pilots is
    reduced or CP is completely removed, the proposed DNN-based receiver outperforms
    the traditional algorithms such as LS and MMSE in terms of error performance.
    Moreover, the DNN-based receiver provides better error performance than LS and
    MMSE in the presence of clipping noise. In [[154](#bib.bib154)], a low complexity
    DNN called SimNet with simple architecture and shorter training has been designed
    to perform channel estimation. A meta-learning-based NN called robust channel
    estimation with meta NNs, RoemNet, is also introduced [[155](#bib.bib155)]. Since
    it leverages meta-learner, RoemNet can tackle new channel learning problems with
    a minimal number of pilots. DeepRx, which improves the channel estimation and
    symbol detection performance significantly by adjusting the inputs of NN in a
    clever way, is another DL-based data-driven approach [[156](#bib.bib156)]. Since
    it supports 5G frame structure including different modulation schemes or pilot
    configurations, DeepRx is compatible with 5G communication systems. The output
    of DeepRx has been determined such that various QAM schemes can be supported by
    training only a single NN. The authors investigated both coded and uncoded error
    performance of DeepRx and compared it to the well-known LMMSE receiver. It is
    indicated that DeepRx outperforms LMMSE for different pilot configurations. Additionally,
    DeepRx has superiority over LMMSE in the presence of Doppler shift and inter-cell
    interference. The aforementioned NNs work with real-valued tensors and this can
    cause DNN to have more complexity and a decrease in their performance. In [[157](#bib.bib157)],
    a deep complex-valued convolutional network, that works in complex fields and
    decodes bits from time domain OFDM signals without requiring any IFFT/FFT operation,
    has been proposed.

- en: A model-driven approach called ComNet [[158](#bib.bib158)], which designs two
    different DNNs for channel estimation and symbol detection blocks, has been proposed
    instead of performing channel estimation and symbol detection jointly in [[153](#bib.bib153)].
    These two DNNs are initialized by conventional wireless communication solutions.
    Thanks to the benefit of expert knowledge, it becomes possible to reduce the need
    for training data and converge faster with the model-driven method compared to
    data driven one [[153](#bib.bib153)]. Additionally, simulation results have shown
    that ComNet outperforms rival channel estimation and symbol detection algorithms
    such as LMMSE channel estimation, fully-connected DNN [[153](#bib.bib153)], MMSE
    symbol detection. The mismatch between the channel model for offline training
    and the real environment, which causes a performance gap between the simulation
    and the over-the-air test, is detected in [[159](#bib.bib159)]. To overcome this
    problem, a novel online training system called SwitchNet receiver is designed
    to catch channel characteristics that were neglected during offline training.
    SwitchNet pretrains multiple channel estimation RefineNet of ComNet with diverse
    channel conditions and selects the network by online learning. Another model-driven
    approach is DeepWiPHY [[160](#bib.bib160)], a DL-based OFDM receiver that is completely
    compatible with the newest Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast to above
    mentioned designs, DeepWiPHY receiver is trained with not only a synthetic data
    set but also a real-world data set created by using universal software radio peripheral
    ([USRP](#glo.acronym.usrp)) modules. Finally, a model-driven technique, that divides
    channel estimation into three CNN-based networks, is also proposed [[161](#bib.bib161)].

    [170](#bib.bib170)] have considered the time frequency response of wireless channel
    as a 2D image as in Fig. [23](#S4.F23 "Figure 23 ‣ 4.1 Transceiver Design ‣ 4
    DL for Multicarrier Waveform Design ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks:
    A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") where LR and HR stand
    for low resolution and high resolution, respectively. In [[163](#bib.bib163)],
    the channel response at the pilot positions is regarded as low resolution image
    and the estimated channel is a high resolution image. A DL-based receiver called
    ChannelNet including two different CNNs, super-resolution CNN [[171](#bib.bib171)]
    and denoising CNN [[172](#bib.bib172)], which improves the resolution of low resolution
    image and eliminates the effect of noise, respectively, is designed. In [[162](#bib.bib162)],
    inspired from the image super resolution technique [[173](#bib.bib173)] and conditioned
    image synthesis technology [[174](#bib.bib174)], two cascaded NNs, channel estimation
    network and channel conditional recovery network, have been used to estimate the
    channel and detect the signal. In [[164](#bib.bib164)], a DL-based channel estimation
    method, that does not need for training, has been introduced for multidimensional
    OFDM signals. Another channel estimation technique, that combines the conventional
    LS estimator with fast super resolution CNN, FSRCNN, [[175](#bib.bib175)] to increase
    the estimation performance, has been presented [[166](#bib.bib166)]. A deep residual
    channel estimation network, ReEsNet, whose architecture is optimized by taking
    advantage of residual learning, [[165](#bib.bib165)] is introduced to outperform
    ChannelNet [[163](#bib.bib163)]. A CNN-based NN architecture called FreqTimeNet [[168](#bib.bib168),
    [169](#bib.bib169)], that performs learning in both time and frequency domain,
    is introduced for channel estimation. FreqTimeNet decreases the complexity by
    facilitating the orthogonality between two domains. Comprehensive simulation results
    have indicated that FreqTimeNet outperforms ChannelNet and ReEsNet. Furthermore,
    another NN design called AttenFreqTimeNet, that includes a widely used DL technique
    called attention mechanism, has been presented. Since it employs SNR information,
    AttenFreqTimeNet outperforms FreqTimeNet. A CNN-based DL structure called dual
    CNN, that takes advantage of both angle-delay domain and spatial-frequency domain,
    is introduced. Moreover, another novel network called HyperNet is proposed to
    further enhance the robustness. In [[170](#bib.bib170)], a GAN-based NN called
    SRGAN is exploited for super resolution to obtain the whole channel response.
    Due to the employment of discriminator, the proposed channel estimator has superiority
    over ReEsNet and traditional techniques such as LMMSE.'

    receiver sides. Thus, the whole OFDM transceiver pipeline can be optimized jointly
    by utilizing the AE-based structure. In [[176](#bib.bib176)], authors have shown
    that it is possible to integrate the E2E system into an OFDM system. Furthermore,
    for wireless picture transmission across multipath fading channels with nonlinear
    disstortion, a DL-based joint source-channel coding technique is given [[177](#bib.bib177)].
    Lastly, in [[178](#bib.bib178)], a DL-based MC system called MC-AE, that optimizes
    modulation and demodulation operations jointly to maximize coding and diversity
    gain, is presented. This MC-AE system is explained in the following subsection

    symbol detection in OFDM-IM-based schemes. In [[179](#bib.bib179)], a fully-connected
    DNN, called DeepIM, is used for symbol detection of OFDM-IM. The efficiency of
    the DNN in signal detection of OFDM-IM is demonstrated in terms of both error
    performance and decoding complexity. A preprocessing based on domain knowledge
    is applied to the received signal before inputting it to DeepIM. CNN-based receiver
    has also been proposed where the received symbols are converted to polar coordinates
    to ease the decoding of information bits transmitted by active subcarriers [[180](#bib.bib180)].
    To enhance the performance of channel estimation and symbol detection for pilot-assisted
    OFDM-IM, complex DNN and complex CNN have been exploited [[181](#bib.bib181)].
    Additionally, a detector called DeepDM that includes both a DNN and a CNN is introduced
    for an OFDM-IM-based scheme, dual-mode OFDM-IM (DM-OFDM-IM) [[182](#bib.bib182)].
    In DeepDM, CNN and DNN are used to detect index bits and QAM/PSK modulated bits,
    respectively. Another receiver called IMNet is also proposed to detect IM-aided
    MIMO-OFDM, IM-MIMO-OFDM, signals [[183](#bib.bib183)]. Finally, the performance
    of DNN-based receiver is investigated for sparse vector coding OFDM which can
    also be considered as a member of OFDM-IM family [[184](#bib.bib184)].

    FBMC, GFDM, and OTFS. In [[185](#bib.bib185)], for two-stage index modulated UFMC
    system, a DL-based signal detector called TSIMNet, is proposed over multipath
    underwater acoustic channels. DNN-based and ResNet-DNN based receivers have been
    presented for channel estimation and symbol detection of FBMC systems in [[186](#bib.bib186),
    [187](#bib.bib187)], respectively. Moreover, in [[188](#bib.bib188)], a damped
    generalized approximation message passing method is suggested to minimize receiver
    complexity in OTFS systems, with the damping factors tuned using DL approaches.
    A data-driven DNN-based method [[189](#bib.bib189)], another low-complexity DNN-based
    technique [[190](#bib.bib190)] that equalizes received signal at the symbol level,
    and 2D CNN-based design [[191](#bib.bib191)] have been proposed for the equalization
    task at the OTFS receiver. Additionally, in [[192](#bib.bib192)], authors have
    presented a novel DNN-based framework for the equalization of both SISO and MIMO-OTFS
    systems. DNN-based transceiver architectures have also been introduced for the
    detection of OTFS signals under IQ imbalance [[193](#bib.bib193)] and PAPR reduction
    [[194](#bib.bib194)]. Lastly, DL-aided receivers are presented for GFDM and GFDM-IM

    where PAPR and BER performance are jointly optimized thanks to its AE-based architecture.
    Furthermore, a low-complex real-valued NN is presented to reduce PAPR and minimize
    BER at the same time [[198](#bib.bib198)]. Since the proposed method in [[198](#bib.bib198)]
    is implemented in the time domain unlike PRNet, it can provide a reduction in
    complexity. Nonetheless, optimizing different metrics increases the computational
    complexity considerably. Motivated from model-driven approach, A DL-based tone
    reservation network, namely TRNet, is proposed to improve only the PAPR performance
    to increase the training speed [[199](#bib.bib199)]. TRNet improves the performance
    of the classical tone reservation method and in contrast to PRNet, it is applied
    only at the transmitter side. Another tone reservation-based DL method called
    DL-TR is introduced in [[200](#bib.bib200)] where conventional tone reservation
    method is unfolded to design a DNN. Moreover, in [[201](#bib.bib201)], a model-driven
    DL-based tone reservation technique, which yields low-complexity due to its clever
    design, is proposed by unfolding an iterative tone reservation scheme as a layer
    of DNN. In [[202](#bib.bib202)], the usage of residual NNs with soft-clipping
    is presented as a novel PAPR reduction approaches. Authors of [[203](#bib.bib203)]
    have proposed to employ a DNN at the transmitter to develop a high-dimensional
    modulation method that enables regulation of both the PAPR and adjacent channel
    leakage ratio. Another NN is implemented at the receiver side to decode information
    bits. Finally, an AE-based PAPR reduction method is introduced for pre-coded OFDM
    signals without reducing the OOBE performance [[204](#bib.bib204)].

    on orthogonal approximate message passing (DL-OAMP) is presented [[205](#bib.bib205),
    [206](#bib.bib206)]. The channel estimation module of ComNet [[158](#bib.bib158)]
    and the OAMP detection NN, OAMP-Net, that merges the OAMP method and DL by incorporating
    a few trainable parameters, are included in the DL-OAMP receiver. Authors have
    shown that the complexity of DL-OAMP is lower than ComNet and DL-OAMP is capable
    of adapting time-varying channels. In [[206](#bib.bib206)], the performance of
    OAMP-NET is investigated not only by extensive simulation and also by employing
    a real communication system. Another model-driven DL method based on OAMP algorithm
    has also been proposed for CP removal in MIMO-OFDM systems [[207](#bib.bib207)].
    Although CP is inserted to time-domain OFDM signal to avoid ICI, its length may
    not be long enough in some practical scenarios. In case of insufficient CP, model-driven
    DL-based receivers are designed for the detection of SISO-OFDM [[208](#bib.bib208)]
    and MIMO-OFDM [[209](#bib.bib209)] signals. In addition to CP, pilot overhead
    needs to be considered in OFDM systems to increase spectral efficiency. In [[210](#bib.bib210)],
    firstly, the number of pilot symbols is removed partially without a decrease in
    error performance. Secondly, by using an AE-based NN, pilots are completely removed
    along with a learned constellation or superimposed pilots. In order to increase
    the throughput considerably, authors of [[211](#bib.bib211)] addressed both CP
    and pilot reduction issues and demonstrated that it is possible to eliminate CP
    and pilot entirely by exploiting E2E learning. In [[212](#bib.bib212)], for frequency
    division duplex massive MIMO-OFDM systems, an NN-based combined downlink pilot
    design and channel estimation approach is presented. An efficient pilot reduction
    approach is also suggested for reducing pilot overhead and saving time-frequency
    resources for data transmission by progressively pruning less important neurons
    from dense layers. Lastly, to solve the channel estimation problem, a pilotless
    AE-based E2E learning technique is presented in [[213](#bib.bib213)] where a CNN
    and two DNN are implemented in the transmitter and receiver side, respectively.

    OFDM signals in fast time varying environment. In [[214](#bib.bib214)], a channel
    estimation network, ChanEstNet, which exploits a CNN and a RNN, is introduced
    for channel estimation in the high speed mobile scenarios. Moreover, this idea
    is extended to MIMO systems [[215](#bib.bib215)]. DL-based cascaded structures
    called ICINet [[216](#bib.bib216)] and Cascade-Net [[217](#bib.bib217)] are also
    proposed for channel estimation and symbol detection for rapidly time varying
    channels. Lastly, AE-based DL technique is also developed to cope with complex

    and drawbacks related to the application of DL-based solutions for MC waveforms.
    One of the most important limitations is the fact that most studies focus on optimizing
    only one performance metric such as BER and PAPR. Unfortunately, the performance
    of MC systems relies on multiple key performance indicators, which should be considered
    in the design process. Implementation of these indicators to DL model design is
    a challenging task and has not been addressed in the literature. Also, the design
    process requires the involvement of various 6G applications such as eMBB, URLLC,
    mMTC, and their possible combinations. These applications require specific challenges
    that need to be considered in the DL model design.

- en: Integration of DL-based techniques in RIS-aided systems has been challenging
    due to complicated training processes since the number of channels to be exploited
    is proportional with the number of reflecting elements. Therefore, the literature
    frequently focuses on this subject. DL-based channel estimation techniques reducing
    the training overhead are also presented in [[237](#bib.bib237)], [[238](#bib.bib238)],
    and [[239](#bib.bib239)] by different learning and network architectures. [[238](#bib.bib238)]
    aimed to strengthen the interaction between channel information and passive beamforming
    of conventional DL-based systems by practicing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
    architecture. [[239](#bib.bib239)] presented a two-stage channel estimation method
    to reduce the training load in mmWave communication schemes. The considered DNN
    is trained with a reduced number of users in the first stage to learn effective
    channel parameters over active users. Then, the authors present a spatial-temporal–spectral
    framework that estimates deficient channel information in the second phase. [[237](#bib.bib237)]
    used a similar approach, in which the channel information obtained with only a
    few active elements was also used to estimate the remaining channels, resulting
    in almost no training overhead. In the first part of the offered two-tier solution,
    the authors performed CSI acquisition with the presented sparse channel sensors
    structure and then used the obtained information to optimize the RIS phase configuration.
    However, the presence of these controlled active elements used in channel reconstruction
    cannot practically meet the standalone operation principle and the passive nature
    of RISs. The presence of those active elements also increases the system.  [[236](#bib.bib236)]
    has been inspired by the high learning and prediction capability of DNNs and aimed
    low system complexity for mmWave communication. The proposed deep unfolding method
    gives higher estimation performance at lower computational complexity and learning
    load compared to the conventional LS estimator. The model-driven unfolding method,
    which is a sub-type of DNN and has the ability to learn from extensive synthetic
    data with lower iteration, follows an algorithm similar to traditional gradient
    descent optimizations. [[240](#bib.bib240)] proposes a novel data-driven channel
    estimator in MISO architecture to achieve reduced system complexity for a similar
    purpose of [[236](#bib.bib236)]. This study benefits from the fact that the CNN
    structure involves fewer parameters compared to prior architectures such as DNN.
    The proposed CNN-based channel estimator has superiority over traditional linear
    estimators in terms of implementation complexity. Nonetheless, extended scenarios,
    including mobility and plurality of users as well as multiple antennas assumption,
    will be vital to realize this architecture in practical applications.

    is to employ fewer pilots. [[241](#bib.bib241)] and [[242](#bib.bib242)] presents
    DL-based approaches achieving reliability in estimation accuracy while reducing
    the pilot overhead. Both studies perform entire channel extrapolation from sampled
    channels. [[241](#bib.bib241)] proposes sequential trained three synthetic DNNs.
    These DNNs first estimate the direct channel and then the cascaded channel. The
    last DNN predicts the cascaded channel by using fully passive elements at the
    final stage. [[242](#bib.bib242)] also used multiple DNNs, which are cascaded
    and sequentially trained. The proposed study enhances the conventional element-grouping
    method by investigating and eliminating channel interference. Sampled channels
    refined by the first DNN as a result of interference elimination are used in the
    prediction of entire channels in the second stage. Both studies gain significant
    improvements in reducing the pilot overhead with reliable channel estimation processes.

    schemes have been the focus of ongoing investigations on RIS-assisted systems.
    In order to measure the performance boundaries in wireless connections utilizing
    RISs, more accurate modeling approaches are necessary for the transmission of
    signals scattered by metasurfaces. Another challenge is that no amplifiers are
    present in an entirely passive RIS architecture. At that point, RISs might need
    a low-powered unit to be informed by current channel conditions and other communications
    blocks such as receivers or transmitters for the purpose of phase optimization.

    is crucial at the transmitter. Nevertheless, it is not a straightforward process
    to retrieve full channel knowledge in practice because of the passive nature of
    RIS-aided schemes. For this reason, the quick and accurate channel acquisition
    required for next-generation technologies causes a high training burden. For the
    present, supervised learning techniques are commonly employed to tackle channel
    issues in order to increase efficiency, and DL approaches investigate [CSI](#glo.acronym.csi)
    structures of current designs. However, due to the limitations mentioned above,
    the research efforts can be expanded with different deployment scenarios. For
    instance, using RISs in a near-field setting might offer several exciting applications
    and benefits.

    technology to be included in the next generation of communication systems. The
    success of phase reconfiguration not only increases the quality of signal transformation
    but also increases the adaptability of RISs to different communication environments
    such as indoor/outdoor applications. Especially in highly dynamic channels, such
    as application scenarios with high mobility, the inadequacy of existing control
    systems has revealed the necessity of a new perspective. In preserving the fully
    passive nature of RISs with reduced costs and system complexity, truly intelligent
    approaches have a bright future for next-generation communications. Therefore,
    DL-based passive beamforming techniques have extensively been addressed by the

    randomly distributed active components. The trained data set, in which the beamforming
    on the RIS side is established as an input-output pair, is built with the supervised
    learning scheme. The use of active elements can be considered as a drawback of
    this study. The possible advantages of the supervised learning-based MLP algorithm
    with fully passive RIS have been inspected in [[254](#bib.bib254)] to overcome
    the storage and computational performance limitations in the dynamic positioning

    The results of the study indicate that the transfer overhead is reduced thanks

    phase values of the response beamforming of the RIS while the mapping is unveiled.
    This architecture is capable of making online predictions thanks to the trained
    DNN in the offline phase. However, the output parameters are unique for each learning
    phase. This contradiction will act as a layer. Therefore, each learning data will

    Besides, the use of active elements on smart surfaces in optimizing the phase

    for the data traffic of a mobile user becomes more complicated due to dynamic
    channels. Moreover, the system parameters cannot be specified as constants because
    of the infinite amount of mobility. This situation makes it challenging to employ
    supervised techniques in which input-output pairs are labeled and learned from
    properly arranged data. Considering the benefits that ML techniques provide in
    the face of complex data in various fields, methods such as computer vision or
    neural language processing can also be regarded from the perspective of communication
    engineering. At this point, structures such as convolutional neural networks may
    be preferred instead of more superficial DNN structures.

    a fundamental restriction in continuing RIS research is the lack of accurate and
    controllable models that define reconfigurable metasurfaces as a function of their
    EM features. As the majority of studies assume, the passive reflection behavior
    of RISs is not applicable in practice. Components such as material composition,
    polarization, and angles influence the RISs response to radio waves. In other
    words, RISs do not just reflect the waves but also re-design them. For RIS topologies,
    practical EM-based circuit designs should be used, which take mutual linking and
    unit cell configurations into account, similar to [[261](#bib.bib261)].

    been mainly seen in user clustering scenarios that have already been studied extensively
    due to their critical role, as mentioned earlier. [[263](#bib.bib263)] provided
    a new idea about possible contributions of intelligent approaches in next-generation
    communication systems by presenting the effect of the DL approach integrated into
    a conventional RIS-assisted NOMA architecture. The proposed study presents a user
    clustering algorithm that reduces computational complexity and creates the optimum
    power allocation with sequential decoding. The study, which designed a *K*-means-based
    ML algorithm for user clustering, benefited from the correlation in the user channels
    of mmWave systems. So the proposed *K*-means-based algorithm also has the ability
    to do online user clustering. This characteristic allows it to outperform traditional
    K-means-based algorithms in terms of performance in lower system complexity. Therebeside,
    a conventional K-means-based Gaussian mixture model is conducted as a clustering
    technique used to interference alignment to cope with growing network traffic
    by [[264](#bib.bib264)]. The proposed method aims to perform passive beamforming
    optimization on the RIS side with the ML algorithm. By this approach, they sought
    an optimized solution for signal decoding, power allocation, and user clustering
    under QoS constraints while the MISO-NOMA downlink scheme is considered for the
    proposed network. A novel Deep Q-network algorithm is adopted in the regulation
    of the power allocation process and the phase configuration on the RIS side.

    the existing studies are insufficient in terms of system complexity, energy efficiency
    and adaptation capability to different channel conditions required by 6G and beyond
    communication technologies. In particular, the high complexity of the systems
    and optimization problems has pushed the current practical studies to single antenna
    system assumption. Therefore, performance improvement of the RIS-assisted NOMA
    in MIMO systems emerges as a subject that needs to be addressed. In RIS-NOMA scenarios,
    imperfect SIC adoption is the main factor that degrades system performance and
    limits the number of users. Considering the current literature, it is evident
    that SIC techniques using conventional optimization algorithms are insufficient
    to obtain adequate performance. For this reason, novel grouping techniques have
    been developed and applied such as [[242](#bib.bib242)]. However, the development
    of advanced interference cancellation processes seems as a bright future for next-generation
    NOMA architecture. Advanced DL approaches for SIC optimization will undoubtedly
    increase the performance of RIS-assisted NOMA systems.

    to check if Alice has this information. Although traditional methods are very
    effective at classifying non-authorized users, delivering prior information to
    Alice securely or keeping it secure is a highly vulnerable step. In PHY security
    methods, the role of prior information is transferred to channel or device characteristics

    et al. in [[280](#bib.bib280)]. The study considers a common PHY authentication
    scenario where the receiver applies a binary hypothesis test based on the received
    signal strength indicator ([RSSI](#glo.acronym.rssi)) values. The decision mechanism
    first calculates the test statistics, i.e., the normalized distance between the
    received [RSSI](#glo.acronym.rssi) value and a reference one. Secondly, test statistics
    are compared with a threshold to decide if the signal is spoofed or not. Here,
    the selection of the threshold is a critical step that directly affects the detection
    performance. As the main contribution, the authors propose a Q-learning-based
    threshold selection algorithm. The algorithm basically searches the action and
    state planes to find the threshold that maximizes the Q-function²²2Q-function
    calculates the expected reward of an action in Q-learning algorithms. Q-learning
    or other reinforcement learning algorithms optimize their objective by maximizing
    a reward value. The reward values are calculated by trial-and-error since the
    system is unsupervised (i.e., labeled data does not exist). In larger problems,
    Q-function is often approximated with [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) algorithms.. The authors
    also investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm using [USRP](#glo.acronym.usrp)
    modules. Test results indicate that a dynamic threshold selection with Q-learning
    outperforms fixed threshold selection. In [[281](#bib.bib281)], the authors extend
    their previous work in [[280](#bib.bib280)] to include Dyna-Q learning method.
    In addition to the results of [[280](#bib.bib280)], experiments reveal that Dyna-Q
    model can improve both learning speed and authentication performance compared
    to Q-learning. The authors also consider the [MIMO](#glo.acronym.mimo) scenario
    in [[282](#bib.bib282)] by extending the algorithms given in [[281](#bib.bib281)].

    is that the receiver is assumed to know reference [RSSI](#glo.acronym.rssi) values
    for the detection mechanism. This assumption is dropped in [[283](#bib.bib283)]
    by generating a decision result with logistic regression. Specifically, the receiver
    uses previous RSSI information to train a logistic regression model and estimates
    the authenticity of the current RSSI value. As a result, the proposed method is
    able to detect spoofers successfully without prior RSSI information, even under
    dynamic and unknown channel models. On the other hand, the study considers a network
    where the receiver obtains RSSI information from multiple spatially distributed
    nodes (landmarks) with multiple antennas to improve detection performance. In [[284](#bib.bib284)],
    the authors extend their work by reducing the computational overhead of the regression
    model. [USRP](#glo.acronym.usrp) experiments verify that the logistic regression-based

    to traditional threshold-based detection mechanisms. DL models learn the best
    decision mechanism from data when traditional methods suffer from the problem
    of threshold selection. An inaccurate threshold selection in a mathematical detection
    model can easily lead to high miss detection or false alarm rates. Moreover, DL-based
    methods in the literature are able to deal with large networks where authentication
    of multiple nodes is required. Creating a DL model that classifies multiple nodes
    simultaneously is possible. On the other hand, the greatest challenge of DL-based
    anti-spoofing methods is to obtain information on the spoofer. DL-based methods
    require training data to generate a model that can distinguish between a spoofer
    and a legitimate user. However, including any information from the spoofer to
    the training data is not practical. Unfortunately, current studies include the
    spoofer’s channel in the training process to train their models. This assumption
    is a critical drawback on implementing DL-based methods in real scenarios.

    frequencies and select the appropriate frequency band. The Q-function is calculated

    states are calculated based on the received SNIR values (features extracted to
    avoid jammed frequencies) and the primary user occupation information. The proposed

    Instead of focusing on avoiding the jammed frequencies (which primarily considers

    Conventional model-based methods first convert raw information into features using
    mathematical models and solve a classification problem to identify jammer types.
    Applying [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) in this process can significantly overcome the

    a [CNN](#glo.acronym.cnn)-based jammer identification method which imitates the
    image processing applications of [DL](#glo.acronym.dl). This method first converts
    one-dimensional data into image format in order to train the network. Although
    simulation results indicate $92\%$ accuracy for identifying three jammer types
    (single-tone jammers that use Gaussian noise with different mean and variance),

    channel capacity in the loss function. Contrary to the spoofing or jamming scenarios,
    DL-based anti-eavesdropping methods do not face a classification problem. Essentially,
    the DL models are expected to optimize their variables for the secrecy rate metric
    which includes the eavesdropper’s channel capacity. However, known DL models and
    loss functions are not fully applicable for this task. As a result, unique DL
    models are still needed to improve the performance of DL-based methods. Similar
    to anti-jamming literature, we should remark that anti-eavesdropping studies lack
    proof of concepts and testbed implementations with real-world datasets. Moreover,
    [DL](#glo.acronym.dl)-assistance is applied to a limited number of communication
    scenarios, i.e., [RIS](#glo.acronym.ris) or [OFDM](#glo.acronym.ofdm) scenarios
    are missing. The following section dwells on the future aspects of our four leading
    research directions and presents our comments.

    communications. The deployment process of the 5G technology has come a long way
    all over the world these days and the active research on the 6G technology has
    also gained tremendous momentum. It is an undeniable fact that 6G technology will
    usher in radical paradigm shifts, new thrilling applications, and groundbreaking
    technologies. AI will undoubtedly play a huge role in this irresistible revolution
    emerging with 6G. Specifically, DL approaches have been building a concrete ground
    and will most likely continue to overtake other AI branches for the bright future
    of wireless communication technologies. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive
    overview of the existing DL-based PHY techniques and shed light on the huge potential
    of emerging DL approaches under four main research directions toward 6G, namely
    massive MIMO systems, MC waveform designs, RIS-aided communications, and PHY security.
    We have analyzed the progress made so far in detail and determined major future
    research directions in each of these fields, as demonstrated in Fig. [30](#S6.F30
    "Figure 30 ‣ 6.3 Anti-Eavesdropping Solutions ‣ 6 PHY Security Meets DL ‣ Deep
    Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY
    Architectures"). Please note that it is possible to add other [PHY](#glo.acronym.phy)
    research directions to the framework that we have covered in this article. In
    fact, the usage of DL grows gradually on other [PHY](#glo.acronym.phy) technologies.
    For instance, the literature also includes [DL](#glo.acronym.dl)-powered studies
    on [mmWave](#glo.acronym.mmwave) or terahertz communications. It has been shown
    that [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) can be employed to efficiently solve various challenges
    of high-frequency communications. Moreover, [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) is also applied
    for the challenges of drone or unmanned aerial vehicle communication networks.
    However, the [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) literature on these technologies is still developing,
    and including them in our [6G](#glo.acronym.6g) framework is a future direction.'

- en: We have investigated the major developments of DL applications for MIMO systems
    from various aspects and identified the missing points that should attract more
    attention. The first issue from an intelligent receiver perspective is that most
    detectors available in the literature require perfect CSI to operate successfully.
    Since it is challenging to estimate channels in practice and even harder in massive
    MIMO systems due to their plenty of transmit antennas, developing a system model
    with a perfect CSI assumption remains a pipe dream. Therefore, receiver frameworks
    based on DL techniques composing channel estimators and symbol detectors should
    become more common in the future to support practicability. Secondly, evaluating
    the proposed models in a computer simulation environment using generic channel
    model assumptions may be deceptive since there are many more impairments in real-life
    scenarios, and we do not know how they impact the performance of DL models. Thus,
    we suggest creating benchmark channel datasets that include real-life impairments
    and encapsulate diverse settings for various wireless communication standards,
    such as 5G and Wi-Fi 7\. These benchmark datasets will allow for fair comparisons
    of DL models. Apart from these, the third vital topic for rapid progress in this
    field is the development of benchmark system models that researchers can compare
    their DL models. The number of novel DL frameworks has been increasing in tandem
    with the advancement of the literature. Hence, new DL-based frameworks should
    be compared to existing novel data-driven methods to prevent the conglomeration
    of similar models.

    advice is to concentrate solely on MU system models that require MU interference
    cancellation since almost all communication systems have been serving MU cases
    for a while. Thus, DL-based precoders should not only eliminate the effect of
    the channel on each user but also prevent a user’s signals from interfering with
    others. The second point is practicability, as in the case of DL-based receiver
    designs. We believe that experiments using SDR testbeds in various environments
    will help us examine the feasibility of DL-based models in dynamically changing
    scenarios. It is also possible to understand the hardware requirements for efficient
    DL operations. The last research direction is the actual enabler of the PHY revolution.
    Considering DL approaches’ ability to optimize a communication system as a whole
    in an E2E fashion, we question if the next-generation wireless communication technologies
    can arise without the restrictive standardization process that requires continuous
    regulations. The ultimate objective is to delegate defining parameters, signaling,
    and other issues that must be resolved throughout the standardization process
    to DL networks, therefore shortening the time between generations.

    most popular one among them. As noted earlier, OFDM has been used in modern wireless
    communication systems including 4G and 5G. Although designed on top of OFDM, other
    MC waveforms such as FBMC and GFDM could not seize the throne. Despite OFDM being
    the most powerful one due to its simplicity and flexibility, other OFDM-based
    waveforms can also be seen as candidates for 6G wireless networks. Nonetheless,
    these waveforms are still needed to be improved to meet the high demands of 6G.
    At this point, DL comes into the picture as a great tool in order to enhance performance
    and reduce the complexity of MC waveforms.

    MC waveforms. With a comprehensive assessment, we conclude that the existing DL-based
    methods have great potential to improve the performance of the aforementioned
    waveforms for 6G and may outperform traditional algorithms. However, there are
    still unaddressed issues related to the application of DL-based solutions for
    MC waveforms. Firstly, most studies focus on optimizing only one performance metric
    such as BER and PAPR. However, in MC systems, there are multiple key performance
    indicators, which should be considered while designing the system. Therefore,
    we believe that it is important to design DL-based techniques that optimize multiple
    performance metrics jointly to improve the overall performance. Secondly, while
    designing a target DL method, specific requirements of different 6G applications,
    such as eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, and their possible combinations, need to be considered.
    Thirdly, most studies in the literature focus on enhancing the performance of
    classical OFDM. Designing DL-based techniques for other MC waveforms is still
    an open topic. Fourthly, the combination of AE-based NNs with IM to increase the
    data rate or improve error performance would be an interesting design problem.
    Lastly, we observe that most of the proposed DL-based solutions have not considered
    real-world data sets. In order to reveal the true potential of DL-based techniques,
    they need to be implemented in practical scenarios by employing wireless communication
    testbeds.

    it is vital to reduce the overall system complexity by preserving the passive
    structure of RISs and achieving high performance at a low cost. Thus, it may be
    crucial to consider the advantages of optimal RIS positioning. In light of the
    aforementioned approaches, the question of how effective RIS configuration should
    be in DL assistance in order to get the best performance will arise. In line with
    these approaches, applicable RIS positioning scenarios can be evaluated for effective
    signaling and channel estimation at the user side, reducing signaling overhead
    and optimizing the transmit power.

    four major RIS deployment scenarios. As shown in Fig. [31](#S7.F31 "Figure 31

    Future Directions ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive

    the BS side or the receiver side, or it can be positioned in a hybrid scheme as
    in Fig. [31](#S7.F31 "Figure 31 ‣ 7.2 Future Directions on Multi-Carrier Waveform

    Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures")(d) to combine
    its advantages in certain aspects. It appears as the most advantageous option
    in terms of signaling overhead due to the close distance between the RIS and the
    BS so that the channel in between is almost static. This also eliminates the coordination
    burden when compared to distributed RIS deployments on the user side. The BS-side
    positioning has the ability to adapt to instant changes in user channels and different
    QoS requirements. On the flip side, compared to the BS-side deployment, it provides
    a more advantageous solution in providing a direct LOS in user-side RIS positioning.
    This is shown as the only aspect where user-side deployment is superior to the
    BS-side in [[302](#bib.bib302)]. However, this situation can be treated as an
    issue that can be improved with the DL approach. Then, BS-side deployment scenarios
    might gleam as bright solutions for optimizing DL-assisted RIS applications. Similarly,
    appropriate positioning by using intelligent surfaces as virtual access points
    in which BS-side positioning, might match the power of an active access point
    by using fully passive elements. These virtual access points increase environmental
    scattering and provide spatial multiplexing gain to the MIMO system as in [[303](#bib.bib303)].
    However, the assumption of the presence of initial CSI can be considered as a
    drawback in these systems. At this point, the development of a DL-based approach
    eliminating the need for initial CSI will provide significant gains in performance.'

    an essential role in reducing signaling overhead and system complexity on the

    be investigated to see if it yields more appealing results than BS-side positioning
    due to the optimization burden caused by increasing system parameters. At this
    juncture, a novel DNN architecture can be used in the learning process of a high
    number of parameters for the estimation of the complex channel information brought
    by the hybrid positioning scenario. These scenarios can be combined with a DL
    approach similar to [[247](#bib.bib247)] and phase optimization on the RIS-side
    can be placed with a model-independent and trained DNN. In order to observe the
    variation of system performance according to changing environmental conditions
    and to determine the optimum working policy, it is vital to create dynamic user
    scenarios for the BS-side RIS deployment. Thereby, a long-term policy with the
    ability to learn for dynamic scenarios can be constituted. By an approach similar
    to [[243](#bib.bib243)], in a scenario, as given in Fig. [32](#S7.F32 "Figure

    NOMA-MIMO systems and increasing the overall system performance in terms of user
    sum-rate. In this way, lower system complexity and power consumption can be addressed,
    which will enable beyond 5G wireless communication technologies. Positioning scenarios
    while preserving the passive nature of RISs can also be considered here first.
    In DL-based studies on RIS-aided downlink-NOMA schemes, a common predicament arises
    with the assumption of having an initial CSI. However, obtaining CSI in a NOMA
    system scheme is another challenge due to the complexity of the underlying communication
    model. These schemes might be integrated with [RNN](#glo.acronym.rnn)-like DL
    approaches that estimate channel state using channel statistics, aiming to reduce
    latency in scenarios without initial CSI. Furthermore, the assumption of imperfect
    SIC at the decoding stage makes preventing MUI difficult with the increasing number
    of users. This is one of the most critical factors degrading the total user performance
    due to the inefficiency of current SIC techniques and restricting user capacity.
    Inspired by [[304](#bib.bib304)], the combination of a novel DL approach seeking
    the perfect SIC with DL-assisted RIS phase optimization can address the aforementioned
    challenges in scenarios using the downlink-NOMA scheme. Novel DL algorithms suitable
    for these scenarios can be tested with DNN or CNN architectures and appropriate
    loss functions can be developed.

    and reflecting RISs (STAR-RIS) can be considered as a field that has a gleaming
    future. By simultaneously transmitting and reflecting the incident signals, STAR-RISs
    may serve both sides of users placed at their front and back, in contrast to RISs,
    which are often distinguished by their reflecting-only property.The concept of
    STAR-RISs has been extensively elaborated by researchers in utilizing the unique
    communication framework to produce smart radio settings, which has been motivated
    by its appealing advantages [[305](#bib.bib305)], [[306](#bib.bib306)], [[307](#bib.bib307)].
    Nevertheless, the fractional shape of the objective function and non-convex restrictions
    make it difficult to solve the energy efficiency maximization problem by locating
    the global optimal solution. DL can be considered as a potential solution to overcome
    the difficulties posed by current optimization methods.

    The existing studies in the literature prove the positive impact of DL on PHY
    security. Although various network or attack models have been considered in the
    past, there are still scenarios where the impact of DL has not been tested. For
    example, the secrecy capacity of OFDM-IM/OFDM systems or RIS-assisted networks
    is widely considered in the literature. However, exploration of the impact of
    DL on these scenarios is still an open area. Moreover, the existing literature
    is very immature such that mostly raw ideas are considered. Their extensions to
    different DL networks and various system models (e.g., power/complexity constraints,
    improved attacker models) are missing and, we believe, is an interesting future
