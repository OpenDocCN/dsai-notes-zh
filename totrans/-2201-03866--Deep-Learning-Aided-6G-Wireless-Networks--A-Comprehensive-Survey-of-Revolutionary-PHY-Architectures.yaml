- en: Deep learning (DL) has proven its unprecedented success in diverse fields such
    as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by its
    strong representation ability and ease of computation. As we move forward to a
    thoroughly intelligent society with 6G wireless networks, new applications and
    use cases have been emerging with stringent requirements for next-generation wireless
    communications. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the potential of DL
    approaches in satisfying these rigorous needs and overcoming the deficiencies
    of existing model-based techniques. The main objective of this article is to unveil
    the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of DL-based physical layer methods
    to pave the way for fascinating applications of 6G. In particular, we have focused
    our attention on four promising physical layer concepts foreseen to dominate next-generation
    communications, namely massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, sophisticated
    multi-carrier waveform designs, reconfigurable intelligent surface-empowered communications,
    and physical layer security. We examine up-to-date developments in DL-based techniques,
    provide comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and introduce a comprehensive
    guide for future directions. We also present an overview of the underlying concepts
    of DL, along with the theoretical background of well-known DL techniques. Furthermore,
    this article provides programming examples for a number of DL techniques and the
    implementation of a DL-based multiple-input multiple-output by sharing user-friendly
    code snippets, which might be useful for interested readers.

    Release-15 standard in March 2017, the brand new 5th generation ([5G](#glo.acronym.5g))
    wireless communication technology has made significant progress worldwide [[1](#bib.bib1)], [[2](#bib.bib2)].
    3GPP completed the Release-17 Stage-2 freeze in June 2021 and is planning the
    next freeze in March 2022 [[3](#bib.bib3)]. As these releases have been proceeding,
    the deployment process of 5G has attained a high level of maturity. According
    to a recent GSA report, 176 operators from 72 countries had launched commercial
    5G networks as of August 2021 [[4](#bib.bib4)]. However, the recent advancements
    in the implementation of 5G have exposed the drawbacks and limitations of this
    technology despite being nominated as the primary enabler of Internet-of-Everything
    ([IoE](#glo.acronym.ioe)) systems [[5](#bib.bib5)]. Even though 5G has introduced
    more flexibility and efficiency to wireless networks by utilizing new technologies
    such as millimeter-wave ([mmWave](#glo.acronym.mmwave)) communication and multi-numerology
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([OFDM](#glo.acronym.ofdm)), the pledged
    revolutionary mobile communication perspective has remained a pipe dream thus
    far [[5](#bib.bib5)], [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Moreover, although 5G systems are ready
    to support data rate-hungry enhanced mobile broadband services and ultra-reliable
    low-latency communications, it is questionable whether they can support future
    IoE applications [[6](#bib.bib6)]. Therefore, researchers have been investigating
    sophisticated communication technologies and developing intriguing concepts for
    6th generation ([6G](#glo.acronym.6g)) wireless networks, which are projected
    to come into life after 2030\. Even if cellular communication systems have advanced
    to a new level with the development of 5G, expectations of the intelligent information
    society of 2030 and beyond will be remarkably compelling. 6G will be the essential
    provider of a highly digital community by connecting everything, enabling almost
    unlimited wireless coverage, establishing full-vertical networks, and supporting
    holographic and high-precision communications for tactile and haptic applications [[7](#bib.bib7)].
    In addition, new IoE services ranging from extended reality applications and flying
    vehicles to space travel and brain-computer interfaces will come to reality with
    6G networks, making 6G the true master of IoE [[5](#bib.bib5)], as illustrated
    in Fig. [1](#S0.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive
    Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures"). However, these new and fascinating
    applications will bring strict and very challenging requirements such as ultra-high
    reliability, low latency, substantially high data rate, high energy and spectral
    efficiency, and dense connectivity. Fig. [2](#S1.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction
    ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary
    PHY Architectures") compares the specifications of 5G and 6G, elucidating the
    6G expectations [[8](#bib.bib8)]. The developments and expectations on the way
    toward these 6G technologies in the literature have also been comprehensively
    reviewed and discussed by some other research groups [[9](#bib.bib9), [10](#bib.bib10),
    [11](#bib.bib11)].'

    might incorporate numerous emerging technologies such as scalable artificial intelligence

    using model-based techniques that provide characteristics of the policy involved.
    These techniques, yet, can be too sophisticated to be implemented physically in
    terms of run time, or they might contain too much abstraction to work in a broad
    environment. Conversely, AI-based solutions may adjust to dynamically changing
    scenarios and localized characteristics by absorbing knowledge of the target communication
    environment. AI can be implemented in a highly configurable infrastructure with
    a wide range of network flexibility. AI has the ability to forecast certain limits
    and handle vast amounts of data so that AI-integrated 6G will assist in processing
    the final volume of metadata with less resources and computational burden.

    neural networks ([NN](#glo.acronym.nn)) first appeared in intelligent systems.
    Machine learning ([ML](#glo.acronym.ml)) and deep learning ([DL](#glo.acronym.dl))
    approaches have been proven to be competitive frameworks over the years for challenging
    tasks such as computer vision, robotics, and natural language processing, in which
    building a concrete mathematical model is relatively difficult. For example, although
    it is almost mission impossible to develop an analytical model or robust algorithm
    for detecting handwritten digits (digit recognition) or different objects in an
    image (image segmentation), DL techniques can accomplish these tasks with a performance
    exceeding human level. On the other hand, communication technologies hinge on
    numerous mathematical models and theories requiring expert knowledge, such as
    information theory and channel modeling. Information signals stream from optimal
    transmitter designs with modulation, coding, and signaling schemes over a range
    of mathematically defined channel models to be reliably detected at the receiver,
    in which each block is optimized individually. In addition to this well-defined
    PHY architecture, the ability of secure transmission along with eliminating various
    hardware imperfections makes communications a complicated and mature field. Therefore,
    ML and DL techniques must reach lofty goals to outperform existing technologies
    and provide discernable advantages. Applying DL approaches to optimize the building
    blocks separately, ranging from modulation and coding schemes ([MCS](#glo.acronym.mcs))
    to symbol detection and channel estimation algorithms, would not produce much

    of communication systems as a whole in complex scenarios, such as unknown channel
    models and ultra-high mobility conditions, is the most fascinating concept that
    we expect to see in 6G, and we call this PHY revolution. Switching from the block
    structure of current PHY communications, where each block is responsible for a
    different signal processing task, to E2E optimization using DL methods represents
    a radical paradigm shift that will entirely transform 6G and beyond wireless communications.

    drawbacks of current systems, particularly in the past couple of years. However,
    despite being exceptionally promising, DL methods experience some difficulties
    that restrict their viability in challenging communication scenarios. The highly-parameterized
    architecture of deep NNs ([DNN](#glo.acronym.dnn) s) necessitates massive datasets
    to learn an appropriate mapping from features to desired outcomes, which increases
    the computing complexity and complicates the training process. Thus, utilizing
    solely data-based DNNs as a black box and leaving all predictions to model weights
    is questionable, at least for now, since datasets regarding communications have
    not reached a satisfactory level yet. Due to the limits of model-based and data-based
    methods, model-driven DNNs have emerged, which combine DNNs’ powerful learning
    and mapping abilities with expert knowledge to get the most potential advantage.
    The two most common model-driven DNN strategies are deep unfolded networks, where
    DNN layers replicate iterations of an existing iterative algorithm, and hybrid
    networks, where DNNs help conventional models and enhance efficiency [[26](#bib.bib26)].
    As the DL literature on communication technologies has progressed, the data scarcity
    problem has also become a thing of the past, paving the way for entirely data-based
    DL systems.

    in massive MIMO detection and channel estimation in order to overcome the drawbacks

    transmission schemes with low complexity. Our long-term objective for intelligent
    massive MIMO systems is to integrate DL-based transmitters and receivers to develop
    innovative E2E communication systems even in unknown channel models. As a glaring
    enhancement for MIMO systems, IM techniques have attracted huge interest recently.

    tasks. Furthermore, by using expert knowledge, model-driven NNs have been presented
    to further improve the performance and decrease the computational complexity.
    Recent studies have focused on transceiver designs optimizing the transmitter

    that present novel frameworks to overcome the existing drawbacks of earlier RIS-based
    systems. We primarily introduce DL approaches constituting intelligent channel
    estimation and signal detection processes. We conclude that employment of DL approaches
    requires less pilots and training overhead than conventional techniques. Furthermore,
    we focus on emerging DL-based NNs eliminating model dependency for phase configuration
    in RIS-assisted schemes. The presented passive beamforming designs prove that
    DL-based processes, which unveil a direct mapping between phase shifts and received
    signal strength, provide robustness in different channel environments with reduced
    computational complexity. We also review the recent studies that present standalone
    operations employing fully passive elements to suit the passive nature of RISs
    and reduce the training overhead. Besides, due to the growing interest in non-orthogonal
    multiple access ([NOMA](#glo.acronym.noma)) solutions for next-generation communication
    systems, we examine DL-based systems improving clustering and power allocation
    performance of RIS-assisted NOMA designs. Thereby, we discuss that the utilization
    of DL approaches provides enhanced flexibility and robust performance under dynamic
    states and the number of users compared to traditional methodologies.

    predictions, classifications, or other decisions by learning data representations.
    Given raw data, in contrast to classical ML methods that strongly depend on domain-expert
    features, DL models generate non-linear input-output mappings to execute actions
    on a goal objective. Fig. [6](#S2.F6 "Figure 6 ‣ 2.1 DL Architecture at a Glance
    ‣ 2 An Overview of DL Techniques ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A
    Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") illustrates the relationship
    between DL, ML, and AI. Each layer in an NN architecture transforms a representation
    to a higher level, where each transformation unlocks the learning of a more sophisticated
    characteristic of raw data. A model may be shallow or deep depending on the number
    of layers, the depth of an NN, imitating either a simplistic or complicated function
    of raw input data by being sensitive to vital features and insensitive to irrelevant
    changes such as environment or nearby objects. Aside from the input and output
    layers, each layer is a hidden layer consisting of hidden units known as neurons.
    During the representation learning process, hidden neurons in a layer calculate
    a weighted sum of their preceding layer’s inputs and transfer the result to the
    next layer through a non-linear activation function, corresponding to one iteration
    of forward-propagation. Starting with the input layer, which passes the weighted
    sum of raw input data to the first hidden layer, each hidden layer handles its
    computation. In the end, the output layer produces the desired outcomes, which
    might be probabilities, category scores, or any other metric. DL researchers have
    identified several activation functions to introduce a non-linearity effect into
    forward-propagation, such as the rectified linear unit ([ReLU](#glo.acronym.relu)),
    leaky ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, and more. The most popular one is the ReLU function
    and defined as $f(a)=\text{max}(a,0)$ [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[30](#bib.bib30)].'

    a loss function by comparing the output scores with desired labels. This loss
    function represents a model error, which is subsequently utilized to update internal
    parameters, also known as model weights. The update of these adjustable weights
    corresponds to the training of the DL model. During training, the algorithm calculates
    the derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight to observe the
    amount of resultant error when weight was increased or decreased. In the opposite
    direction of forward-propagation, the algorithm computes weight gradients using
    the chain rule [[31](#bib.bib31)], which obtains derivatives going backward, called
    backpropagation. DL model updates its weights by changing them in the reverse
    direction of calculated gradients to decrease the error value after backpropagation [[29](#bib.bib29)].
    The update rule is one of the most critical aspects of DL applications since it
    highly impacts overall learning performance and training time. Thus, researchers
    have developed different optimizers, including momentum [[32](#bib.bib32)], root
    mean square propagation, stochastic gradient descent ([SGD](#glo.acronym.sgd)) [[33](#bib.bib33)],
    adaptive moment estimation ([ADAM](#glo.acronym.adam)) [[34](#bib.bib34)], and
    many more. Recently, Facebook Research has published a new update algorithm, called
    MADGRAD [[35](#bib.bib35)], and the DL world is debating whether this new technique
    can replace the ADAM optimizer. Fig. [7](#S2.F7 "Figure 7 ‣ 2.1 DL Architecture
    at a Glance ‣ 2 An Overview of DL Techniques ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless
    Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures") demonstrates
    a single run of a training procedure including forward-propagation, loss calculation,
    and backpropagation for a single hidden layer DNN, where the given variables will
    be defined shortly. A typical DL model takes hundreds of millions of these iterations
    to ensure that the model observes a good deal of instances and that the model
    error converges to a reasonable value depending on the application. A testing
    procedure follows training to examine whether the model can generalize to unseen
    occurrences, also known as the compositionality of DL models. The difference between
    training and test loss values represents model variance and indicates that the
    model is overfitting, in which DL model memorizes rather than learning. On the
    other hand, the difference between training and the Bayes error values corresponds
    to model bias and reveals that the model is underfitting, which necessitates more
    training. It is a common mistake to investigate model bias by comparing training
    error with zero error. Indeed, the Bayes error, the known optimal value that can
    be human-level performance or other values, should be the benchmark for bias,
    which is not necessarily zero.'

    architecture presumes similarity between various areas of a 2D feature vector
    and aims at capturing correlations between these parts, as shown in Fig. [8](#S2.F8
    "Figure 8 ‣ 2.1 DL Architecture at a Glance ‣ 2 An Overview of DL Techniques ‣
    Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary
    PHY Architectures")(b) [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[30](#bib.bib30)], [[37](#bib.bib37)].
    The first key idea underlying the motivation of the CNN architecture is local
    connections. In contrast to DNNs, where each hidden unit links with all hidden
    units of the former and latter layers, CNNs connect a single unit in a convolutional
    layer to a local patch in the previous layer. Raw input data of a CNN model consists
    of multiple 2D feature vectors corresponding to channels. For example, a $28\times
    28$ RGB image comprises three 2D feature vectors representing the pixels in the
    RGB color channels. It is most likely that local regions of an RGB image are correlated,
    and statistics are comparable, which means a pattern appearing in an area might
    also come out of another region, such as two ears of a cat in different parts
    of an image [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[37](#bib.bib37)]. Therefore, it is logical to
    utilize these spatial relationships and link a patch of input data to a hidden
    unit rather than a fully connected structure [[37](#bib.bib37)].'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second major characteristic that forms the CNN baseline is weight sharing.
    Each local patch in the 2D feature vector connects to a distinct hidden unit in
    the following convolutional layer, where all links use the same weight matrix.
    The motivation behind weight sharing is to decrease the number of learnable parameters.
    The example given in [[37](#bib.bib37)] describes this motivation perfectly. Let
    us assume that we have $482\times 415$ input data with three channels, where the
    input size is $600090$. Considering the dense connection of DNNs, the parameter
    size is approximately $600$K for a single hidden unit in the next layer, increasing
    to more than $600$M for $1000$ hidden units. Many parameters increase the training
    time substantially, crack the available memory, and necessitate powerful regularizers

    spanning local patches provides $4800$ learnable parameters, allowing $125$ hidden
    layers with $1000$ units each against a single hidden layer in the dense connection.
    As a result, the number of parameters and model size reduce significantly along
    with the enhancement of the generalization capacity, preventing memorizing data
    rather than learning.

    local regions to hidden units. Specifically, a CNN model calculates the weighted
    sum of a patch in the 2D feature vector by the convolution operation to pass the
    patch’s features to a single hidden unit of the next layer. A single patch represents
    the window of the CNN forward-propagation whose size determines the size of the
    shared weight matrix, and CNN travels across all windows to move on to the following
    layer. These windows might, and most probably, intersect, in which the shifting
    size corresponds to the stride of the current convolutional layer. A simple example
    of this windowing procedure and the convolution operation is given in Fig. [9](#S2.F9

    and the $2\times 3$ output data $\mathbf{Y}$ both include a single channel; however,
    they might differ depending on the model architecture. When there are more channels

    input patches [[37](#bib.bib37)]. Pooling layers enable the CNN model to become
    robust to minor distortions without requiring additional learnable parameters [[29](#bib.bib29)], [[37](#bib.bib37)].
    The stride value of a pooling layer is generally as large as the window size.
    The initial stages of a CNN model are typically composed of stacked convolution,
    non-linear activation function, and pooling, followed by further convolutional
    and dense layers [[29](#bib.bib29)]. The loss calculation and backpropagation

    natural language processing, thanks to their ability to utilize previous parts.

    a variety of improvements such as extremely high data rate and spectral efficiency.
    The brand new mobile communication technology, 5G, has attracted the attention
    of both academic and industrial circles with the promise of a maximum of 20 Gb/s
    peak data rate along with other major improvements in latency and energy/spectrum
    efficiency. The key enabler of a fully intelligent world, 6G, will introduce even
    higher specs such as a peak data rate of at least 1 Tb/s and a user-experienced
    data rate of 1 Gb/s [[5](#bib.bib5)]. These significant improvements are possible
    with the use of multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver sides as in
    early standards, which is known as the MIMO technology. MIMO systems can provide
    spatial diversity gain where the transmitted symbols are received from multiple
    paths and the fading effect is mitigated. Alternatively, spatial multiplexing
    gain is obtained by MIMO systems where the capacity of the channel increases linearly
    with the minimum of transmit and receive antennas [[44](#bib.bib44)]. Scaling
    up the conventional MIMO systems with a few hundred antennas that simultaneously
    serve many users, massive multi-user ([MU](#glo.acronym.mu)) MIMO technology has
    become a breakthrough. Massive MU-MIMO utilizes all the benefits of the conventional
    MIMO while eliminating the MU interference to further enhance the transmission
    performance, which can be seen in Fig. [15](#S3.F15 "Figure 15 ‣ 3 DL for Emerging
    MIMO Systems ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
    of Revolutionary PHY Architectures"). Massive MIMO provides 10 times or more capacity
    compared to the conventional MIMO via its powerful spatial multiplexing ability.
    In addition, it enhances the energy efficiency on the order of 100 times via the
    ability of sharp beamforming to the small regions with a large number of antennas [[45](#bib.bib45)].'

- en: Although massive MIMO technology brings immense benefits, it comes at some prices.
    The most shining feature of massive MIMO, spatial multiplexing, requires reliable
    channel state information ([CSI](#glo.acronym.csi)). During the downlink transmission
    of conventional MIMO systems such as in the Long Term Evolution (4G) standard,
    the base station ([BS](#glo.acronym.bs)) transmits a pilot sequence so that the
    users estimate the channel responses and feed them back to the BS. Nevertheless,
    this method is not suitable for massive MIMO systems since each user would have
    to estimate a few hundred channel responses which gives rise to a huge feedback
    overhead. Another reason is that pilots should be orthogonal between the antennas
    and this requires a considerable amount of orthogonal resources [[45](#bib.bib45)].
    Another challenge of massive MIMO technology is the number of required radio frequency
    ([RF](#glo.acronym.rf)) chains. When each transmit antenna at the BS is activated
    to transmit a different symbol, the number of required RF chains equals the number
    of transmit antennas and this increases the hardware cost. As a promising solution
    to the inherent problems of MIMO mentioned above, IM appears as a strong candidate
    for next-generation wireless communication technologies. Along with decreasing
    the need for the massive number of RF chain requirements, IM techniques provide
    high energy and spectral efficiency by conveying additional information bits utilizing
    the indices of the building blocks of a communication system [[12](#bib.bib12)].
    One of the most critical shortcomings of IM techniques is the detection complexity.
    The more bits transmitted via IM, the more complex the detector becomes. The optimum
    detector is the maximum likelihood detector ([MLD](#glo.acronym.mld)) and in some
    cases, it is impossible to use it because of its unacceptable level of complexity.
    At this point, linear detectors, such as zero-forcing ([ZF](#glo.acronym.zf))
    and minimum-mean squared error ([MMSE](#glo.acronym.mmse)) detectors, take place
    with the cost of a worse bit error rate ([BER](#glo.acronym.ber)). Thus, there
    is a trade-off between the complexity and the BER performance of currently used
    model-based detectors.

    vital topic in efficient massive MU-MIMO systems. The BS uses precoding before
    transmission to mitigate the fading channel impact and cancel MU interference.
    However, precoding techniques that currently exist in the standards require high-resolution
    digital-to-analog converters ([DAC](#glo.acronym.dac) s) which bring high complexity
    to the system. Therefore, the design of precoders with low-resolution DACs is
    of interest among the issues of intelligent massive MIMO transmitter design. Within
    the context of intelligent MIMO transmitters, another blooming topic is constellation
    design since the performance of communication systems is highly affected by the
    shape of the constellation. From their infancy to the cutting-edge technology,
    information bits are modulated by a limited number of constellations such as quadrature
    amplitude modulation ([QAM](#glo.acronym.qam)) and phase-shift keying ([PSK](#glo.acronym.psk)).
    Next-generation intelligent MIMO transmitters are expected to modulate information
    bits by using complex-shaped constellations that are optimized for the transmission
    environments. It is the mission of the intelligent black box to find the best
    locations for the constellation points and to optimize the decision boundaries
    for these points [[46](#bib.bib46)]. However, to obtain a performance improvement
    concerning the conventional constellation designs, the receiver must be aware
    of the decision boundaries of the used complex-shaped constellations. Therefore,
    it is mission impossible for the conventional detectors to decode information
    bits without the initial knowledge of the constellation design. This is where
    E2E learning appears as one of the remarkably charming concepts for the next-generation
    wireless communication systems, where the aim is to fully optimize both the transmitter
    and receiver by representing the whole system as an autoencoder ([AE](#glo.acronym.ae)) [[47](#bib.bib47)].

    the trade-off between computational complexity and BER performance. The MLD operates
    depending on a strong mathematical model and it is proved that MLD provides the
    optimum BER performance under ideal conditions [[48](#bib.bib48), [49](#bib.bib49)].
    Since DL techniques, especially DNNs, are general function approximators, the
    model of the MLD can be represented by NNs with significantly low complexity.
    These approximations are not expected to outperform MLD. Instead, it is expected
    to reach the performance of MLD without requiring the impractical complexity of
    MLD. In what follows, we reveal and summarize a brief overview of the literature
    in this direction.

    called DetNet for a MIMO system. The structure of DetNet is slightly different
    than a well-known DNN, where it is designed based on the iterative projected gradient
    descent algorithm. The BER performance of the DetNet is compared to the state-of-the-art
    detectors, approximate message passing ([AMP](#glo.acronym.amp)), and semidefinite
    relaxation ([SDRX](#glo.acronym.sdrx)) under the assumption of perfect CSI at
    the receiver. As a similar approach to [[50](#bib.bib50)] and [[51](#bib.bib51)],
    the study in [[52](#bib.bib52)] aims to create a model-driven DL-based detector
    for a MIMO system based on the existing iterative detection algorithm, orthogonal
    AMP ([OAMP](#glo.acronym.oamp)). The proposed network, OAMP-Net, wields some additional
    trainable parameters to improve the BER performance of the OAMP detector under

    symbols in a MIMO system as the non-linear data-based part of the detector. The
    rest of the APM symbols are detected by a conventional ZF detector as the linear
    model-based part of the detector. This scheme also requires perfect CSI at the

    channels are implemented to analyze the BER performance of the detector. For a
    range of pilot overhead percentages in the transmitted signal, the proposed detector
    is compared to the theoretical BER of the Rayleigh fading channel and the decision
    feedback equalizer without requiring CSI at the receiver.

    in MIMO system models with IM techniques. Within this context, data-driven and
    model-driven DNNs are investigated in [[48](#bib.bib48)] and [[49](#bib.bib49)],
    respectively. Instead of a single giant DNN, the work in [[48](#bib.bib48)] suggests
    utilizing data-driven sub-DNNs for the detection process of a MIMO system with
    generalized spatial modulation ([GSM](#glo.acronym.gsm)). The proposed architecture
    performs similarly to the MLD and the single DNN detector with lower complexity
    under the assumption that the fading channel is fixed and the noise is independent
    and identically distributed ([i.i.d.](#glo.acronym.iid)) Gaussian. However, when
    the noise is correlated or has a deviation in its distribution, the sub-DNN architecture
    outperforms the MLD and the single DNN detector. CSI at the receiver is not necessary
    for fixed fading channels, but it is essential for time-varying channels. On the
    other hand, in [[49](#bib.bib49)], the authors propose a model-driven DL-based
    block detector for GSM inspired by linear block detectors such as Block-ZF and
    Block-MMSE detectors. The APM symbol of each active transmit antenna is detected
    by a DNN, assuming that perfect CSI is available at the receiver. The B-DNN model
    outperforms the linear detectors and performs similarly to the MLD with lower
    complexity.

    is stacking the hidden layers to build a deep network and to increase the learning
    ability. However, the authors in [[55](#bib.bib55)] realize that deepening the
    network after a certain number of hidden layers does not considerably improve
    the BER performance. Therefore, they propose a parallel detection network, where
    several DL detection networks perform in parallel to introduce a diversity effect.
    In order to obtain diversity, a special loss function is designed. Detection is
    carried out based on the perfect knowledge of the CSI. Likewise, in [[56](#bib.bib56)],
    a DL-based detector composed of many parallel modified DNNs introduces a diversity
    gain in a MIMO system model. The modified DNNs employ the residual learning principle
    and differ in several ways and introduce diversity to the system. Assuming perfect
    CSI, computer simulations unveil that the proposed detector outperforms the ZF,
    MMSE, and single DNN-based detectors.

    attention. Within this perspective, the work in [[57](#bib.bib57)] compares DNN-
    and CNN-based detectors to address the issues of robust detection with imperfect
    CSI and efficient DL framework for low-complex detection. This comparison reveals
    that the DNN-based detector performs significantly better in terms of the BER
    performance. In addition, it outperforms the ZF, MMSE, and DetNet [[50](#bib.bib50)], [[51](#bib.bib51)]
    detectors with both perfect and imperfect CSI at the receiver. However, the MLD
    detector has a considerably better BER performance than the proposed detector.
    With a similar approach, DNN-, CNN-, and RNN-based detectors are designed without
    channel dependency and compared to the MLD in [[58](#bib.bib58)]. Computer simulations
    in this study show that the RNN-based approach performs the best, whereas the
    DNN-based approach is the poorest. The fact that DNN-based architecture outperforms
    CNN-based architecture in [[57](#bib.bib57)] but degrades in [[58](#bib.bib58)]
    demonstrates that the optimum DL architecture is dependent on the system model
    and environment.

    real-world conditions. However, according to [[59](#bib.bib59)] and [[60](#bib.bib60)],
    the main issue with the existing DL-based detectors is either unpleasant performance
    over practical spatially correlated channels or a computational burden because
    of retraining for each channel realization. Thus, the authors of [[59](#bib.bib59)]
    focus on a robust DL-based MIMO detector that can optimize itself via online training
    during the transmission over realistic and spatially correlated channel models.
    The proposed detector, called MMNet, is built upon iterative soft-thresholding
    algorithms. Experiments conducted by using a dataset of channel realizations from
    the 3GPP 3D MIMO channel indicate that MMNet outperforms the classical approaches
    such as AMP and SDRX, as well as recent DL techniques like DetNet [[50](#bib.bib50)], [[51](#bib.bib51)],
    and OAMPNet [[52](#bib.bib52)], under the assumption of perfect CSI. The work
    in [[60](#bib.bib60)] introduces an additional NN, a HyperNetwork, that eliminates
    the need for online retraining on top of a modified version of MMNet to create
    the HyperMIMO detector. Computer simulation results reveal that the HyperMIMO
    detector outperforms MMSE and OAMPNet [[52](#bib.bib52)] and performs similarly
    to the MMNet and the MLD with less computing cost under the perfect CSI.

    symbol detection are implemented iteratively by another DNN to enhance the performance
    of the estimation, which is called data-aided channel estimation. Computer simulations

    design the pilot signals for the users at the initial part of the pilot-aided
    estimation stage. Subsequently, separate DNNs estimate the channels of the users
    using successive interference cancellation ([SIC](#glo.acronym.sic)). The suggested

    of RF chains is limited. The authors of [[70](#bib.bib70)] propose a learned denoising-based
    AMP ([LDAMP](#glo.acronym.ldamp)) network to solve this problem. The LDAMP network
    is an image recovery network that treats the channel matrix as a 2D image, with
    a single pilot for all channels in the antenna array. The LDAMP network outperforms
    the conventional AMP variants. The study in [[71](#bib.bib71)] focuses on DNN-based
    direction-of-arrival ([DOA](#glo.acronym.doa)) estimation in addition to DNN-based
    channel estimation. Specifically, two DNN-based algorithms operate DOA and channel
    estimation processes without the need for pilot symbols. Extensive computer simulations
    verify that the suggested DOA and channel estimation algorithms exceed the traditional
    techniques in terms of mean squared error ([MSE](#glo.acronym.mse)) of DOA and
    BER performance. Motivated by the drawbacks of [[70](#bib.bib70)], the authors
    of [[72](#bib.bib72)] develop a better denoising network based on CNNs along with
    the LDAMP network, resulting in the fully convolutional denoising AMP algorithm.
    The required pilot length is less than the number of channel components to be
    estimated. The fully convolutional denoising AMP algorithm has a successive performance
    over LDAMP [[70](#bib.bib70)] and other variants of AMP in terms of both normalized
    MSE ([NMSE](#glo.acronym.nmse)) and achievable sum rate. Another channel estimator
    built upon the classical learned AMP ([LAMP](#glo.acronym.lamp)) method is presented
    in [[73](#bib.bib73)], which is prior-aided Gaussian mixture LAMP. In the first
    stage of the Gaussian mixture LAMP algorithm, a new shrinkage function is developed
    based on the Gaussian mixture distribution of beamspace channel elements. Then,
    the Gaussian mixture LAMP-based beamspace channel estimation is performed depending
    on the derived shrinkage function in the second stage. The proposed algorithm
    outperforms the OMP, AMP, and LAMP algorithms in terms of NMSE. The methods suggested
    in [[70](#bib.bib70)], [[72](#bib.bib72)], and [[73](#bib.bib73)] are simulated
    using the well-known Saleh-Valenzuela channel model. The study [[73](#bib.bib73)]

    way for reliable prediction even with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters
    ([ADC](#glo.acronym.adc) s). In [[76](#bib.bib76)], a massive MIMO BS equipped
    with mixed-resolution ADCs implements channel estimation with DNNs. A direct-input
    DNN estimates channels using the received signals of all antennas, whereas a selective-input
    prediction DNN estimates channels of the antennas with low-resolution ADCs via
    received signals of the antennas with high-resolution ADCs. The proposed algorithm
    has a superior performance over the classical MMSE and the expectation-maximization
    Gaussian-mixture generalized AMP methods. The idea of using mixed-resolution ADCs
    is improved in [[77](#bib.bib77)], where the authors propose an optimization technique
    for mixed-resolution ADCs allocation along with the channel estimation and pilot
    design. Specifically, the CENet estimates channels, the SELNet assigns one-bit
    and high-resolution ADCs, and the PDNet constructs the pilot matrix. The suggested
    framework outperforms the conventional generalized AMP ([GAMP](#glo.acronym.gamp))
    and gridless GAMP in terms of NMSE. Besides, the complete framework is compared
    with the partial scenarios in which all antennas at the BS have one-bit ADCs,
    and only the CENet exists. Another partial scheme includes all one-bit ADC antennas
    with both PDNet and CENet. The partial design with non-optimized high-resolution
    ADCs, PDNet, and CENet performs similarly to the complete framework.

    accurate channel estimation is possible despite complete one-bit ADCs. The study
    in [[78](#bib.bib78)] presents a DNN-based channel estimator for one-bit massive
    MIMO systems. The pilot signal is divided into segments in the first stage, where
    each one forms the input of a DNN. The estimated channel is the average of all
    DNNs’ outputs. Next, detected data symbols using the initial estimation are interpreted
    as the remaining pilot signals and utilized to update the initial channel estimation,
    similar to the procedure in [[67](#bib.bib67)]. The proposed algorithm surpasses
    the traditional LS and Bussgang linear MMSE algorithms in terms of MSE under both
    i.i.d. and spatially correlated channels. Similarly, the work in [[79](#bib.bib79)]
    proposes a DNN-based channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO systems. The authors
    perform investigations to determine the length and architecture of the pilot sequence
    required to ensure that the quantized received signals are mapped to the channel
    matrix. According to these analyses, the more BS antennas, the better the channel
    estimation performance for the same pilot length. Equivalently, the more BS antennas,
    the less required pilot length for the same channel estimation performance. The
    suggested network outclasses the GAMP algorithm under the indoor massive MIMO
    channel scenario offered by [[74](#bib.bib74)] and [[75](#bib.bib75)]. As opposed
    to the former one-bit channel estimators, [[80](#bib.bib80)] introduces a conditional
    generative adversarial network ([GAN](#glo.acronym.gan)) that can learn an adaptive
    loss function to optimize the training procedure and predict the channels. The
    proposed conditional GAN algorithm is compared with expectation maximization Gaussian-mixture
    GAMP algorithm, two-stage algorithm [[67](#bib.bib67)], LDAMP, channel and DOA

    to assume that the downlink and uplink channels are reciprocal, and the BS feedbacks
    the estimated uplink channels to the users. Nevertheless, the detection performance
    degrades when the channel is not reciprocal. Thus, the authors of [[81](#bib.bib81)]

    dynamic channels. The suggested network, called DeepSM, consists of two parallel
    DNNs, with the upper DNN updating the CSI and the lower one detecting the transmitted
    symbols at each time slot. The initial CSI is computed using the LS technique
    utilizing a pilot signal with a length equal to the number of transmit antennas.
    DeepSM is compared to the conventional model-based and data-driven DNN-based receivers
    over both time-variant and time-invariant channel models. Both benchmarks implement
    LS channel estimation and assume that the channel is invariant during the whole
    simulation. Subsequently, the conventional model-based receiver employs MLD detection,
    whereas the data-driven DNN-based receiver detects the transmitted symbols by
    a DNN. Extensive computer simulations reveal that DeepSM outperforms the benchmark
    schemes in all scenarios. Similar to the iterative architecture of DeepSM, the
    work in [[88](#bib.bib88)] proposes a model-driven DL-based joint channel estimation
    and symbol detection network, OAMP-Net2, by unfolding the existing iterative algorithm
    OAMP. OAMP-Net2 performs initial pilot-based channel estimation and detects information
    symbols afterward. Following that, data-aided channel estimation and symbol detection

    learn a whole transmitter framework tuned with the corresponding receiver architecture.
    The basic idea underlying E2E communications is to replace the separate blocks
    of a MIMO transmitter, channel, and receiver with a single DL network that can
    be trained as an AE to address the conventional block structure’s sub-optimization
    issue [[25](#bib.bib25)], [[94](#bib.bib94)]. As a departure, we will first delve

    is an E2E process since the network must optimize both the positions and decision
    regions of the constellation points. The objective is to maximize the mutual information
    between the input and output of the channel, even when the channel model is unknown [[46](#bib.bib46)].
    The study in [[95](#bib.bib95)] provides an AE for designing optimal constellations
    and receiver architectures for additive white Gaussian noise ([AWGN](#glo.acronym.awgn))
    channels with additive radar interference. The optimization metric is mutual information.
    Under various channel model assumptions for different SNR regimes, several demapping
    procedures are suggested. In addition, the proposed network enables using powerful
    coding methods such as turbo codes or low-density parity-check ([LDPC](#glo.acronym.ldpc))
    codes. Computer simulations reveal that the AE-based network outperforms the architectures
    with the traditional constellations. The network in [[96](#bib.bib96)] conducts
    probabilistic shaping to improve the constellations along with the geometric shaping.
    The probabilistic shaping optimizes the probability of occurrence of the constellation
    points. Even when the geometry of the constellation is fixed, such as QAM, the
    probabilistic shaping improves the achievable information rate. This network also
    maximizes mutual information using AEs, as in [[95](#bib.bib95)]. The proposed
    joint shaping method achieves near-capacity performance and outperforms both non-shaped
    QAM and just geometric-shaped QAM across AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. [[97](#bib.bib97)]
    analyzes AE-based constellation design over a MU interference channel to address
    the dynamic interference problem. Specifically, the adaptive DL-based AE network
    can learn the degree of interference and enhance BER performance by adjusting
    each user’s constellation accordingly. According to computer simulations, users’
    learned constellations are well-decomposed, and they concentrate on their clusters
    in the face of heavy interference. It is, therefore, much easier for the receiver
    to decode the information in the strong-interference environment. Furthermore,
    the AE-based network performs very similar to the typical uncoded binary PSK ([BPSK](#glo.acronym.bpsk))

    propagation environments than the traditional fixed constellations, DL-based approaches
    have also been applied to precoding in massive MIMO transmitters. The goal is
    to use DL networks to offer reliable precoding with low-resolution DACs while
    substantially decreasing complexity. The study in [[99](#bib.bib99)] investigates
    a one-bit precoding design with the optimum constellation design utilizing AEs.
    In a multicast massive MU-MIMO system where the BS broadcasts the information
    signal to all users, the transmitter composes a DNN followed by a binary layer
    to satisfy the one-bit precoding constraint. Because the gradients of the binary
    layer are always zero, implementing the standard backpropagation approach is complicated.
    Therefore, the authors employ an approximation which is a variant of the straight-through
    estimator. Experiments over fixed and varying channels show that the AE-based
    one-bit precoding and constellation design network outperforms the PSK and QAM
    transmissions with the conventional one-bit precoder [[100](#bib.bib100)]. It
    is also worth noting that the performance of the AE-based constellation design
    with the standard one-bit precoder [[100](#bib.bib100)] is the best, demonstrating
    the potential of model-driven DL networks. Likewise, [[101](#bib.bib101)] provides

    power normalization at the end. As seen from computer simulations, the AE-based
    precoding network surpasses the conventional linear precoding techniques such

    bits to symbols, while the second does precoding. The receiver of this AE-based
    approach includes a radio transformer network ([RTN](#glo.acronym.rtn)). The precoding
    network at the transmitter and the RTN at the receiver are trained in an E2E fashion
    to outclass the classical DL-based MIMO system. Simulations with different MIMO
    configurations reveal that the proposed combined precoding and RTN architecture

    envelope precoding in [[112](#bib.bib112)]. The suggested network, CEPNet, optimizes
    the traditional approach by introducing trainable parameters to decrease MU interference

    Unlike previous studies, the authors develop a CNN-based precoding scheme to compare
    their model-driven method to a data-driven network. Extensive simulation results
    in a massive MU-MIMO system model with varying numbers of transmit antennas and
    users show that the proposed method reaches the sum rate of the WMMSE algorithm
    and outperforms the CNN-based scheme with much less complexity. By unfolding,

    This improvement is the consequence of the uneven distribution of power across
    antennas. In the second case, another AE is trained to obtain spatial multiplexing
    with lower BER than a traditional MIMO system in a $2\times 2$ MIMO setting. Similar

    modulation order selection scheme without considering the coding rate of the system.
    The recommended DNN model predicts the optimal modulation order by maximizing
    the minimum Euclidean distance, similar to the methods implemented in TAS-IM algorithms.
    Simulation results indicate that DNN-based modulation order selection aided SM-MIMO
    significantly outperforms the classical SM with substantially lower complexity
    than conventional selection algorithms.

- en: GSM is one of the most promising techniques for the PHY of future wireless communication
    systems by combining the benefits of SM and MIMO. Reducing the number of required
    RF chains by activating only a subset of the transmit antennas, GSM has lower
    complexity than conventional MIMO. It also improves SM efficiency by activating
    more transmit antennas and conveying more information bits. However, when the
    number of transmit antenna combinations and information bits increases, the complexity
    of MLD detection escalates to intolerable levels, as discussed earlier. On the
    other hand, linear detectors, such as ZF and MMSE detectors, produce significantly
    worse BER performance than MLD, introducing a trade-off into GSM systems. To address
    this BER-complexity trade-off, the authors of [[49](#bib.bib49)] suggest a DNN-based
    detector for GSM systems. They consider a GSM system model with $N_{t}$ transmit
    and $N_{r}$ receive antennas $(N_{r}<N_{t})$, where $N_{p}$ $(2\leq N_{p}\ll N_{t})$
    out of $N_{t}$ transmit antennas are selected by index bits to be activated in
    any time slot. There are $N=2^{\lfloor\text{log}_{2}\binom{N_{t}}{N_{p}}\rfloor}$
    legitimate transmit antenna combinations ([TAC](#glo.acronym.tac)), where each
    active antenna transmits a symbol from normalized $M$-QAM constellation $\mathcal{S}$.
    Thus, the total number of bits transmitted in each time slot equals $B=\text{log}_{2}N+N_{p}\text{log}_{2}M$.

    two stages: FVG and feed-forward DNN. In the first stage, the FVG generates the

    $\mathbf{H}_{I}$ corresponding to the $i^{\text{th}}$ legitimate TAC. As described

    and the joint FVG results in the best performance among the other FVG types for
    the model suggested in [[130](#bib.bib130)]. Hence, the authors of [[49](#bib.bib49)]
    explore the influence of FVG type on detection reliability and evaluate the BER
    performance of the block-DNN detector for three FVG kinds described in [[130](#bib.bib130)]:
    separate FVG, joint FVG, and conventional FVG. Combining the feature vectors of
    all legitimate TACs, the FVG creates the feature matrix $\mathbf{D}$ and feeds
    it to the feed-forward DNN. In the second stage, the DNN yields a $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{I}$
    for each $\mathbf{d}_{i}$. The feed-forward DNN contains $N_{p}$ sub-DNNs to estimate
    the QAM symbol corresponding to each active transmit antenna. Finally, the block-DNN
    detector employs ([13](#S3.E13 "In 3.6 MIMO-DL in Action ‣ 3 DL for Emerging MIMO
    Systems ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of

    codes. The training procedure of any block-DNN detector ignores the GSM scheme
    at the transmitter, assuming all transmit antennas are active, which makes sense
    since DNN is only responsible for detecting QAM symbols given a TAC. In addition,
    the received signal does not experience AWGN during the training. Here is an example
    model creation of a DNN with separate FVG for QPSK transmission, which is another
    version of model definition in Keras different than what we provided in Section

- en: Waveform, which characterizes the physical shape of information-carrying signals,
    is one of the key components of wireless communication systems [[20](#bib.bib20)].
    Existing waveforms can be categorized into two groups as single-carrier (SC) and
    MC waveforms. In order to increase the data rate in a SC or MC system, symbol
    duration needs to be decreased or equivalently bandwidth occupied for data transmission
    should be increased. However, with the adoption of wider bandwidth, SC waveforms
    suffer from frequency-selective fading that causes inter-symbol interference (ISI)
    since symbol duration is less than the delay spread of the wireless channel. Since
    complex equalization techniques should be applied to reduce ISI, it is very challenging
    to provide high data rates with the existing SC waveforms. In an MC system, the
    frequency band is divided into many sub-bands which are also known as subcarriers [[142](#bib.bib142)].
    These subcarriers are employed in parallel to convey information bits simultaneously.
    The spacing between two consecutive subcarriers is selected such that each of
    them undergoes flat fading in the frequency domain. Hence, a simple single-tap
    equalizer may be utilized to remove the channel effect in MC systems. Consequently,
    MC techniques enable wideband transmission to convey information; therefore, they
    yield higher data rates than SC techniques.

- en: OFDM appears as the most popular MC waveform and has been used in numerous standards
    such as LTE and the IEEE 802.11 family due to its simple and effective structure.
    Owing to the overlapped orthogonal subcarriers, OFDM is capable of using the spectrum
    efficiently. Moreover, the time frequency grid of OFDM allows the flexible use
    of resource elements. In conventional OFDM systems, modulated data symbols for
    each data subcarrier are determined in the frequency domain by mapping information
    bits to the PSK/QAM constellation. A certain number of subcarriers are allocated
    for the transmission of pilot symbols in order to perform channel estimation at
    the receiver side. These pilot symbols can be inserted into the OFDM symbol with
    block or comb type methods [[143](#bib.bib143)]. Channel coefficients can be estimated
    in the time-domain or frequency-domain and numerous estimation techniques, which
    provide different performance and complexity, have been proposed for these two
    domains [[144](#bib.bib144), [145](#bib.bib145)]. In the frequency domain, the
    channel frequency response is estimated by exploiting pilot symbols and is interpolated
    to obtain the channel frequency response over data symbols. For example, the least
    squares (LS) and the linear minimum mean error square ([LMMSE](#glo.acronym.lmmse))
    are two well-known frequency domain channel estimation methods. After inserting
    pilot symbols, the time domain OFDM signal is obtained by employing the inverse
    fast Fourier transform ([IFFT](#glo.acronym.ifft)). Furthermore, a CP is embedded
    in the beginning or end of the OFDM symbol to eliminate ISI. Additionally, the
    CP allows us to model the frequency selective channel as circular convolution.
    After adding a CP, the OFDM signal is transmitted through the wireless communication
    channel. At the receiver side, the CP is removed and the frequency domain OFDM
    signal is acquired by taking FFT. Channel estimation is performed and equalization
    is applied to remove the effect of the wireless channel. Finally, the signal is
    demodulated to obtain information.

- en: Although OFDM has several advantages as discussed above, it also has many drawbacks
    such as high PAPR, sensitivity to frequency and timing errors, high out-of-band
    emissions ([OOBE](#glo.acronym.oobe)), and CP&pilot overhead. After IFFT operation,
    the subcarriers are randomly summed up in the time domain and this may cause high
    peaks due to the overlapping of the peak amplitudes of different signals. The
    power amplifier at the transmitter works in the nonlinear region due to these
    high peaks, generating distortion and spectral dispersion. These peaks give rise
    to high PAPR that reduces the efficiency of the power amplifier, analog-to-digital,
    and digital-to-analog converters. Therefore, researchers have designed various
    PAPR reduction techniques for OFDM transmission systems [[146](#bib.bib146)].
    Another drawback of OFDM is sensitivity to intercarrier interference ([ICI](#glo.acronym.ici))
    caused by high mobility, phase noise, timing offset, and carrier frequency offset
    (CFO). The channel in a mobile wireless environment rapidly changes with respect
    to time. This places a strain on the receiver since it must precisely estimate
    the channel prior to coherent detection. The most critical consequence of this
    time variation is the distortion of the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting
    in ICI, whose intensity is determined by the amount of channel time variation.
    Furthermore, ICI may also occur due to the frequency difference between the local
    oscillators of the transmitter and receiver. Since ICI disrupts OFDM subcarriers,
    data detection becomes less accurate, and a single tap equalizer can not provide
    satisfactory performance. Thus, more complicated methods are required to decode
    OFDM symbols. To combat this difficult interference mitigation problem under high
    mobility environments or in the presence of CFO, several decoding algorithms have
    been proposed [[147](#bib.bib147)]. Another important concern with OFDM systems
    is their excessive out-of-band emissions (OOBE) that should be diminished to prevent
    adjacent channel interference. The OFDM signal has a rectangular pulse in the
    time domain, which generates a sinc signal in the frequency domain. The sidelobes
    of the sinc signals at the edge carriers bring tremendous interference; therefore,
    they should be minimized. OOBE decreases through various windowing/filtering methods
    together with guard band allocation to fulfill the spectrum mask criteria of the
    different standards. Nonetheless, spectral efficiency degrades due to the fixed
    guard band allocation. Lastly, in OFDM systems, inserting CP and pilot symbols
    is highly indispensable. However, the spectral efficiency reduces because of reserving
    a considerable number of resources for CP and pilot overhead.

- en: In recent years, many different and attractive OFDM-based MC waveforms have
    been designed to alleviate the drawbacks of OFDM. Windowed-OFDM ([W-OFDM](#glo.acronym.w-ofdm))
    has been proposed to reduce OOBE by applying windowing operation to classical
    OFDM. Filter bank MC ([FBMC](#glo.acronym.fbmc)) [[148](#bib.bib148)], which implements
    subcarrier-wise filtering operation, has been introduced. FBMC can use the spectrum
    more efficiently and is more resilient under high mobility compared to OFDM in
    the expense of additional signal processing. Generalized frequency division multiplexing
    ([GFDM](#glo.acronym.gfdm)) [[149](#bib.bib149)], which also performs filtering
    at the subcarrier level like FBMC, appears as a remarkably flexible waveform since
    it does not have to meet the orthogonality requirement. Another engaging waveform
    is universal filtered MC ([UFMC](#glo.acronym.ufmc)) that applies filtering to
    subbands instead of subcarriers [[150](#bib.bib150)]. UFMC needs less redundancy
    in comparison to FBMC; however, it is not applicable for very high data rates.
    As mentioned previously, since the orthogonality of its subcarriers is disrupted,
    OFDM is highly susceptible to high Doppler which leads to ICI. Orthogonal time
    frequency space ([OTFS](#glo.acronym.otfs)) modulation appears as a promising
    waveform that brings a clever solution to this disadvantage of OFDM [[151](#bib.bib151)].
    Even in high-Doppler channels, OTFS assures that each transmitted symbol has a
    near-constant channel gain by converting the time-varying multipath channel into
    a two-dimensional delay-Doppler channel. Finally, OFDM with IM ([OFDM-IM](#glo.acronym.ofdm-im))
    emerges as a promising OFDM-based waveform that changes only the modulation/demodulation
    processes of plain OFDM system and offers an additional degree of freedom for
    waveform design thanks to the flexibility of IM [[152](#bib.bib152)]. It is clear
    that all waveforms mentioned above have both some advantages and disadvantages
    over OFDM. Because of its simple structure, OFDM was chosen for also 5G networks,
    and we believe that it will maintain its importance for future wireless systems.

    problems in designing MC transmission systems. For instance, DL can be used to
    improve the subblocks of MC systems such as channel estimation and symbol detection
    or to optimize the whole transmission and reception pipeline jointly. In literature,
    a vast number of interesting DL-based methods are developed to enhance the performance
    of existing MC schemes. Under the subsection of transceiver design, as seen from

    receiver and transceiver designs, that is the studies that focus on the joint
    optimization of both transmitter and receiver structures, is provided. For the
    receiver design, most studies mainly focus on the implementation of DL-based techniques
    for channel estimation and symbol detection. For the transceiver design, the processing
    blocks at the transmitter and receiver are devised together by using AE-based
    approaches to optimize the system as a whole.

- en: DL has been implemented for channel estimation and symbol detection in an OFDM
    system for the first time in [[153](#bib.bib153)]. In this study, DNNs have been
    shown to be capable of learning and evaluating wireless channel properties. The
    proposed DNN architecture, which is trained with the simulated OFDM symbols, has
    been designed as data-driven and fully-connected. When the number of pilots is
    reduced or CP is completely removed, the proposed DNN-based receiver outperforms
    the traditional algorithms such as LS and MMSE in terms of error performance.
    Moreover, the DNN-based receiver provides better error performance than LS and
    MMSE in the presence of clipping noise. In [[154](#bib.bib154)], a low complexity
    DNN called SimNet with simple architecture and shorter training has been designed
    to perform channel estimation. A meta-learning-based NN called robust channel
    estimation with meta NNs, RoemNet, is also introduced [[155](#bib.bib155)]. Since
    it leverages meta-learner, RoemNet can tackle new channel learning problems with
    a minimal number of pilots. DeepRx, which improves the channel estimation and
    symbol detection performance significantly by adjusting the inputs of NN in a
    clever way, is another DL-based data-driven approach [[156](#bib.bib156)]. Since
    it supports 5G frame structure including different modulation schemes or pilot
    configurations, DeepRx is compatible with 5G communication systems. The output
    of DeepRx has been determined such that various QAM schemes can be supported by
    training only a single NN. The authors investigated both coded and uncoded error
    performance of DeepRx and compared it to the well-known LMMSE receiver. It is
    indicated that DeepRx outperforms LMMSE for different pilot configurations. Additionally,
    DeepRx has superiority over LMMSE in the presence of Doppler shift and inter-cell
    interference. The aforementioned NNs work with real-valued tensors and this can
    cause DNN to have more complexity and a decrease in their performance. In [[157](#bib.bib157)],
    a deep complex-valued convolutional network, that works in complex fields and
    decodes bits from time domain OFDM signals without requiring any IFFT/FFT operation,
    has been proposed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A model-driven approach called ComNet [[158](#bib.bib158)], which designs two
    different DNNs for channel estimation and symbol detection blocks, has been proposed
    instead of performing channel estimation and symbol detection jointly in [[153](#bib.bib153)].
    These two DNNs are initialized by conventional wireless communication solutions.
    Thanks to the benefit of expert knowledge, it becomes possible to reduce the need
    for training data and converge faster with the model-driven method compared to
    data driven one [[153](#bib.bib153)]. Additionally, simulation results have shown
    that ComNet outperforms rival channel estimation and symbol detection algorithms
    such as LMMSE channel estimation, fully-connected DNN [[153](#bib.bib153)], MMSE
    symbol detection. The mismatch between the channel model for offline training
    and the real environment, which causes a performance gap between the simulation
    and the over-the-air test, is detected in [[159](#bib.bib159)]. To overcome this
    problem, a novel online training system called SwitchNet receiver is designed
    to catch channel characteristics that were neglected during offline training.
    SwitchNet pretrains multiple channel estimation RefineNet of ComNet with diverse
    channel conditions and selects the network by online learning. Another model-driven
    approach is DeepWiPHY [[160](#bib.bib160)], a DL-based OFDM receiver that is completely
    compatible with the newest Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast to above
    mentioned designs, DeepWiPHY receiver is trained with not only a synthetic data
    set but also a real-world data set created by using universal software radio peripheral
    ([USRP](#glo.acronym.usrp)) modules. Finally, a model-driven technique, that divides
    channel estimation into three CNN-based networks, is also proposed [[161](#bib.bib161)].

    DL for Multicarrier Waveform Design ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks:

    for low resolution and high resolution, respectively. In [[163](#bib.bib163)],
    the channel response at the pilot positions is regarded as low resolution image
    and the estimated channel is a high resolution image. A DL-based receiver called
    ChannelNet including two different CNNs, super-resolution CNN [[171](#bib.bib171)]
    and denoising CNN [[172](#bib.bib172)], which improves the resolution of low resolution
    image and eliminates the effect of noise, respectively, is designed. In [[162](#bib.bib162)],
    inspired from the image super resolution technique [[173](#bib.bib173)] and conditioned
    image synthesis technology [[174](#bib.bib174)], two cascaded NNs, channel estimation
    network and channel conditional recovery network, have been used to estimate the
    channel and detect the signal. In [[164](#bib.bib164)], a DL-based channel estimation
    method, that does not need for training, has been introduced for multidimensional
    OFDM signals. Another channel estimation technique, that combines the conventional
    LS estimator with fast super resolution CNN, FSRCNN, [[175](#bib.bib175)] to increase
    the estimation performance, has been presented [[166](#bib.bib166)]. A deep residual
    channel estimation network, ReEsNet, whose architecture is optimized by taking
    advantage of residual learning, [[165](#bib.bib165)] is introduced to outperform
    ChannelNet [[163](#bib.bib163)]. A CNN-based NN architecture called FreqTimeNet [[168](#bib.bib168),
    [169](#bib.bib169)], that performs learning in both time and frequency domain,
    is introduced for channel estimation. FreqTimeNet decreases the complexity by
    facilitating the orthogonality between two domains. Comprehensive simulation results
    have indicated that FreqTimeNet outperforms ChannelNet and ReEsNet. Furthermore,
    another NN design called AttenFreqTimeNet, that includes a widely used DL technique
    called attention mechanism, has been presented. Since it employs SNR information,
    AttenFreqTimeNet outperforms FreqTimeNet. A CNN-based DL structure called dual
    CNN, that takes advantage of both angle-delay domain and spatial-frequency domain,
    is introduced. Moreover, another novel network called HyperNet is proposed to
    further enhance the robustness. In [[170](#bib.bib170)], a GAN-based NN called
    SRGAN is exploited for super resolution to obtain the whole channel response.
    Due to the employment of discriminator, the proposed channel estimator has superiority
    over ReEsNet and traditional techniques such as LMMSE.'

    by utilizing the AE-based structure. In [[176](#bib.bib176)], authors have shown
    that it is possible to integrate the E2E system into an OFDM system. Furthermore,
    for wireless picture transmission across multipath fading channels with nonlinear
    disstortion, a DL-based joint source-channel coding technique is given [[177](#bib.bib177)].

    symbol detection in OFDM-IM-based schemes. In [[179](#bib.bib179)], a fully-connected
    DNN, called DeepIM, is used for symbol detection of OFDM-IM. The efficiency of
    the DNN in signal detection of OFDM-IM is demonstrated in terms of both error
    performance and decoding complexity. A preprocessing based on domain knowledge
    is applied to the received signal before inputting it to DeepIM. CNN-based receiver
    has also been proposed where the received symbols are converted to polar coordinates
    to ease the decoding of information bits transmitted by active subcarriers [[180](#bib.bib180)].
    To enhance the performance of channel estimation and symbol detection for pilot-assisted
    OFDM-IM, complex DNN and complex CNN have been exploited [[181](#bib.bib181)].
    Additionally, a detector called DeepDM that includes both a DNN and a CNN is introduced
    for an OFDM-IM-based scheme, dual-mode OFDM-IM (DM-OFDM-IM) [[182](#bib.bib182)].
    In DeepDM, CNN and DNN are used to detect index bits and QAM/PSK modulated bits,
    respectively. Another receiver called IMNet is also proposed to detect IM-aided
    MIMO-OFDM, IM-MIMO-OFDM, signals [[183](#bib.bib183)]. Finally, the performance

    system, a DL-based signal detector called TSIMNet, is proposed over multipath
    underwater acoustic channels. DNN-based and ResNet-DNN based receivers have been
    presented for channel estimation and symbol detection of FBMC systems in [[186](#bib.bib186),

    generalized approximation message passing method is suggested to minimize receiver
    complexity in OTFS systems, with the damping factors tuned using DL approaches.

    where PAPR and BER performance are jointly optimized thanks to its AE-based architecture.
    Furthermore, a low-complex real-valued NN is presented to reduce PAPR and minimize
    BER at the same time [[198](#bib.bib198)]. Since the proposed method in [[198](#bib.bib198)]
    is implemented in the time domain unlike PRNet, it can provide a reduction in
    complexity. Nonetheless, optimizing different metrics increases the computational
    complexity considerably. Motivated from model-driven approach, A DL-based tone
    reservation network, namely TRNet, is proposed to improve only the PAPR performance
    to increase the training speed [[199](#bib.bib199)]. TRNet improves the performance
    of the classical tone reservation method and in contrast to PRNet, it is applied
    only at the transmitter side. Another tone reservation-based DL method called
    DL-TR is introduced in [[200](#bib.bib200)] where conventional tone reservation
    method is unfolded to design a DNN. Moreover, in [[201](#bib.bib201)], a model-driven
    DL-based tone reservation technique, which yields low-complexity due to its clever
    design, is proposed by unfolding an iterative tone reservation scheme as a layer
    of DNN. In [[202](#bib.bib202)], the usage of residual NNs with soft-clipping
    is presented as a novel PAPR reduction approaches. Authors of [[203](#bib.bib203)]
    have proposed to employ a DNN at the transmitter to develop a high-dimensional
    modulation method that enables regulation of both the PAPR and adjacent channel
    leakage ratio. Another NN is implemented at the receiver side to decode information
    bits. Finally, an AE-based PAPR reduction method is introduced for pre-coded OFDM
    signals without reducing the OOBE performance [[204](#bib.bib204)].

    on orthogonal approximate message passing (DL-OAMP) is presented [[205](#bib.bib205),
    [206](#bib.bib206)]. The channel estimation module of ComNet [[158](#bib.bib158)]
    and the OAMP detection NN, OAMP-Net, that merges the OAMP method and DL by incorporating
    a few trainable parameters, are included in the DL-OAMP receiver. Authors have
    shown that the complexity of DL-OAMP is lower than ComNet and DL-OAMP is capable
    of adapting time-varying channels. In [[206](#bib.bib206)], the performance of
    OAMP-NET is investigated not only by extensive simulation and also by employing
    a real communication system. Another model-driven DL method based on OAMP algorithm
    has also been proposed for CP removal in MIMO-OFDM systems [[207](#bib.bib207)].
    Although CP is inserted to time-domain OFDM signal to avoid ICI, its length may
    not be long enough in some practical scenarios. In case of insufficient CP, model-driven
    DL-based receivers are designed for the detection of SISO-OFDM [[208](#bib.bib208)]
    and MIMO-OFDM [[209](#bib.bib209)] signals. In addition to CP, pilot overhead
    needs to be considered in OFDM systems to increase spectral efficiency. In [[210](#bib.bib210)],
    firstly, the number of pilot symbols is removed partially without a decrease in
    error performance. Secondly, by using an AE-based NN, pilots are completely removed
    along with a learned constellation or superimposed pilots. In order to increase
    the throughput considerably, authors of [[211](#bib.bib211)] addressed both CP
    and pilot reduction issues and demonstrated that it is possible to eliminate CP
    and pilot entirely by exploiting E2E learning. In [[212](#bib.bib212)], for frequency
    division duplex massive MIMO-OFDM systems, an NN-based combined downlink pilot
    design and channel estimation approach is presented. An efficient pilot reduction
    approach is also suggested for reducing pilot overhead and saving time-frequency
    resources for data transmission by progressively pruning less important neurons
    from dense layers. Lastly, to solve the channel estimation problem, a pilotless
    AE-based E2E learning technique is presented in [[213](#bib.bib213)] where a CNN
    and two DNN are implemented in the transmitter and receiver side, respectively.

    disrupts the orthogonality between subcarriers and makes the detection process
    considerably challenging. DL emerges as an interesting tool to be able to detect
    OFDM signals in fast time varying environment. In [[214](#bib.bib214)], a channel
    estimation network, ChanEstNet, which exploits a CNN and a RNN, is introduced
    for channel estimation in the high speed mobile scenarios. Moreover, this idea
    is extended to MIMO systems [[215](#bib.bib215)]. DL-based cascaded structures
    called ICINet [[216](#bib.bib216)] and Cascade-Net [[217](#bib.bib217)] are also
    proposed for channel estimation and symbol detection for rapidly time varying
    channels. Lastly, AE-based DL technique is also developed to cope with complex
    and fast varying environments in marine communications [[218](#bib.bib218)].

    and drawbacks related to the application of DL-based solutions for MC waveforms.
    One of the most important limitations is the fact that most studies focus on optimizing

    of MC systems relies on multiple key performance indicators, which should be considered
    in the design process. Implementation of these indicators to DL model design is
    a challenging task and has not been addressed in the literature. Also, the design
    process requires the involvement of various 6G applications such as eMBB, URLLC,
    mMTC, and their possible combinations. These applications require specific challenges

    acquisition carries critical importance for 6G and beyond technologies. The main
    inspiration behind DL-based solutions is balancing the trade-off between system
    complexity and achievable rate performance. Therefore, as can be seen in Table [8](#S5.T8

    combined channel estimation scenarios with the DL approach and performed channel
    estimation for both reflected and direct paths. The proposed channel estimation
    technique, which employs the [CNN](#glo.acronym.cnn) architecture, is highly dataset
    dependent. The diversity of data sets influences performance efficiency, which
    can sometimes limit the performance to local dimensions. This causes high training
    overhead during channel estimation learning. To overcome this problem, [[235](#bib.bib235)]
    created the architecture of deep denoising NNs, that reduces the training load.
    In this model, the intelligent surface contains both active and passive elements
    concurrently. This architecture combines compressed sensing and DL approaches
    to achieve greater efficiency than either approach alone. However, the presence
    of active elements increases hardware complexity. Assuming that one of the main
    purposes is to reduce complexity in traditional mmWave massive MIMO architecture,
    this can be regarded as an issue that must be addressed.

    due to complicated training processes since the number of channels to be exploited
    is proportional with the number of reflecting elements. Therefore, the literature
    frequently focuses on this subject. DL-based channel estimation techniques reducing
    the training overhead are also presented in [[237](#bib.bib237)], [[238](#bib.bib238)],
    and [[239](#bib.bib239)] by different learning and network architectures. [[238](#bib.bib238)]
    aimed to strengthen the interaction between channel information and passive beamforming
    of conventional DL-based systems by practicing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
    architecture. [[239](#bib.bib239)] presented a two-stage channel estimation method
    to reduce the training load in mmWave communication schemes. The considered DNN
    is trained with a reduced number of users in the first stage to learn effective
    channel parameters over active users. Then, the authors present a spatial-temporal–spectral
    framework that estimates deficient channel information in the second phase. [[237](#bib.bib237)]
    used a similar approach, in which the channel information obtained with only a
    few active elements was also used to estimate the remaining channels, resulting
    in almost no training overhead. In the first part of the offered two-tier solution,
    the authors performed CSI acquisition with the presented sparse channel sensors
    structure and then used the obtained information to optimize the RIS phase configuration.
    However, the presence of these controlled active elements used in channel reconstruction
    cannot practically meet the standalone operation principle and the passive nature
    of RISs. The presence of those active elements also increases the system.  [[236](#bib.bib236)]
    has been inspired by the high learning and prediction capability of DNNs and aimed
    low system complexity for mmWave communication. The proposed deep unfolding method
    gives higher estimation performance at lower computational complexity and learning
    load compared to the conventional LS estimator. The model-driven unfolding method,
    which is a sub-type of DNN and has the ability to learn from extensive synthetic
    data with lower iteration, follows an algorithm similar to traditional gradient
    descent optimizations. [[240](#bib.bib240)] proposes a novel data-driven channel
    estimator in MISO architecture to achieve reduced system complexity for a similar
    purpose of [[236](#bib.bib236)]. This study benefits from the fact that the CNN
    structure involves fewer parameters compared to prior architectures such as DNN.
    The proposed CNN-based channel estimator has superiority over traditional linear
    estimators in terms of implementation complexity. Nonetheless, extended scenarios,
    including mobility and plurality of users as well as multiple antennas assumption,
    will be vital to realize this architecture in practical applications.

    is to employ fewer pilots. [[241](#bib.bib241)] and [[242](#bib.bib242)] presents
    DL-based approaches achieving reliability in estimation accuracy while reducing
    the pilot overhead. Both studies perform entire channel extrapolation from sampled
    channels. [[241](#bib.bib241)] proposes sequential trained three synthetic DNNs.
    These DNNs first estimate the direct channel and then the cascaded channel. The
    last DNN predicts the cascaded channel by using fully passive elements at the
    final stage. [[242](#bib.bib242)] also used multiple DNNs, which are cascaded
    and sequentially trained. The proposed study enhances the conventional element-grouping
    method by investigating and eliminating channel interference. Sampled channels
    refined by the first DNN as a result of interference elimination are used in the
    prediction of entire channels in the second stage. Both studies gain significant
    improvements in reducing the pilot overhead with reliable channel estimation processes.

    schemes have been the focus of ongoing investigations on RIS-assisted systems.
    In order to measure the performance boundaries in wireless connections utilizing
    RISs, more accurate modeling approaches are necessary for the transmission of
    signals scattered by metasurfaces. Another challenge is that no amplifiers are
    present in an entirely passive RIS architecture. At that point, RISs might need
    a low-powered unit to be informed by current channel conditions and other communications
    blocks such as receivers or transmitters for the purpose of phase optimization.

    is crucial at the transmitter. Nevertheless, it is not a straightforward process
    to retrieve full channel knowledge in practice because of the passive nature of
    RIS-aided schemes. For this reason, the quick and accurate channel acquisition
    required for next-generation technologies causes a high training burden. For the
    present, supervised learning techniques are commonly employed to tackle channel
    issues in order to increase efficiency, and DL approaches investigate [CSI](#glo.acronym.csi)
    structures of current designs. However, due to the limitations mentioned above,
    the research efforts can be expanded with different deployment scenarios. For
    instance, using RISs in a near-field setting might offer several exciting applications
    and benefits.

    CSI for direct mapping. The proposed algorithm is capable of learning the relation
    between RIS configuration and achievable rate correlated with dynamic receiver
    positioning. Since [[256](#bib.bib256)] is one of the studies that give the closest

    on the RIS side. Therebeside, real-time tuned reflecting elements allow phase

    results obtained in combining RIS architectures with DL approaches do not adequately
    meet the flexibility and required performance for 6G and beyond wireless communication
    systems. In particular, the limitations are presented by both the transmitter
    and the user perspectives, such as the high computational complexity, the high
    training overhead, and the perfect [CSI](#glo.acronym.csi) assumption in the transmitter.
    Besides, the use of active elements on smart surfaces in optimizing the phase
    configuration does not comply with the fully passive nature of RISs. The urgent
    need to achieve high energy efficiencies at the lowest possible cost should be
    considered. It is clear that the literature still contains many gaps that require
    work in light of these problems. Examination of different RIS positioning scenarios,
    optimization of system performances over computer simulation, and application
    scenarios under different environmental conditions, in which the DL approach enhances
    channel estimation and phase configuration optimization, is vital in designing
    promising perspectives on related research problems for 6G and beyond.

    the assumption of a static environment. Though, in dynamic scenarios, the mobility
    of users includes some additional parameters such as speed, acceleration, and
    position that need to be considered in the process. Therefore, the learning process
    for the data traffic of a mobile user becomes more complicated due to dynamic
    channels. Moreover, the system parameters cannot be specified as constants because
    of the infinite amount of mobility. This situation makes it challenging to employ
    supervised techniques in which input-output pairs are labeled and learned from
    properly arranged data. Considering the benefits that ML techniques provide in
    the face of complex data in various fields, methods such as computer vision or
    neural language processing can also be regarded from the perspective of communication
    engineering. At this point, structures such as convolutional neural networks may
    be preferred instead of more superficial DNN structures.

    a fundamental restriction in continuing RIS research is the lack of accurate and
    controllable models that define reconfigurable metasurfaces as a function of their
    EM features. As the majority of studies assume, the passive reflection behavior
    of RISs is not applicable in practice. Components such as material composition,
    polarization, and angles influence the RISs response to radio waves. In other
    words, RISs do not just reflect the waves but also re-design them. For RIS topologies,
    practical EM-based circuit designs should be used, which take mutual linking and

    been mainly seen in user clustering scenarios that have already been studied extensively
    due to their critical role, as mentioned earlier. [[263](#bib.bib263)] provided
    a new idea about possible contributions of intelligent approaches in next-generation
    communication systems by presenting the effect of the DL approach integrated into
    a conventional RIS-assisted NOMA architecture. The proposed study presents a user
    clustering algorithm that reduces computational complexity and creates the optimum
    power allocation with sequential decoding. The study, which designed a *K*-means-based
    ML algorithm for user clustering, benefited from the correlation in the user channels
    of mmWave systems. So the proposed *K*-means-based algorithm also has the ability
    to do online user clustering. This characteristic allows it to outperform traditional
    K-means-based algorithms in terms of performance in lower system complexity. Therebeside,
    a conventional K-means-based Gaussian mixture model is conducted as a clustering
    technique used to interference alignment to cope with growing network traffic
    by [[264](#bib.bib264)]. The proposed method aims to perform passive beamforming
    optimization on the RIS side with the ML algorithm. By this approach, they sought
    an optimized solution for signal decoding, power allocation, and user clustering
    under QoS constraints while the MISO-NOMA downlink scheme is considered for the

    and adaptation capability to different channel conditions required by 6G and beyond

    and optimization problems has pushed the current practical studies to single antenna
    system assumption. Therefore, performance improvement of the RIS-assisted NOMA
    in MIMO systems emerges as a subject that needs to be addressed. In RIS-NOMA scenarios,
    imperfect SIC adoption is the main factor that degrades system performance and
    limits the number of users. Considering the current literature, it is evident
    that SIC techniques using conventional optimization algorithms are insufficient
    to obtain adequate performance. For this reason, novel grouping techniques have
    been developed and applied such as [[242](#bib.bib242)]. However, the development
    of advanced interference cancellation processes seems as a bright future for next-generation

    to check if Alice has this information. Although traditional methods are very
    effective at classifying non-authorized users, delivering prior information to

    et al. in [[280](#bib.bib280)]. The study considers a common PHY authentication
    scenario where the receiver applies a binary hypothesis test based on the received
    signal strength indicator ([RSSI](#glo.acronym.rssi)) values. The decision mechanism
    first calculates the test statistics, i.e., the normalized distance between the
    received [RSSI](#glo.acronym.rssi) value and a reference one. Secondly, test statistics
    are compared with a threshold to decide if the signal is spoofed or not. Here,
    the selection of the threshold is a critical step that directly affects the detection
    performance. As the main contribution, the authors propose a Q-learning-based
    threshold selection algorithm. The algorithm basically searches the action and
    state planes to find the threshold that maximizes the Q-function²²2Q-function
    calculates the expected reward of an action in Q-learning algorithms. Q-learning
    or other reinforcement learning algorithms optimize their objective by maximizing
    a reward value. The reward values are calculated by trial-and-error since the
    system is unsupervised (i.e., labeled data does not exist). In larger problems,
    Q-function is often approximated with [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) algorithms.. The authors
    also investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm using [USRP](#glo.acronym.usrp)
    modules. Test results indicate that a dynamic threshold selection with Q-learning
    outperforms fixed threshold selection. In [[281](#bib.bib281)], the authors extend

    In addition to the results of [[280](#bib.bib280)], experiments reveal that Dyna-Q

    for the detection mechanism. This assumption is dropped in [[283](#bib.bib283)]
    by generating a decision result with logistic regression. Specifically, the receiver
    uses previous RSSI information to train a logistic regression model and estimates
    the authenticity of the current RSSI value. As a result, the proposed method is
    able to detect spoofers successfully without prior RSSI information, even under
    dynamic and unknown channel models. On the other hand, the study considers a network
    where the receiver obtains RSSI information from multiple spatially distributed
    nodes (landmarks) with multiple antennas to improve detection performance. In [[284](#bib.bib284)],
    the authors extend their work by reducing the computational overhead of the regression

    to traditional threshold-based detection mechanisms. DL models learn the best
    decision mechanism from data when traditional methods suffer from the problem
    of threshold selection. An inaccurate threshold selection in a mathematical detection
    model can easily lead to high miss detection or false alarm rates. Moreover, DL-based
    methods in the literature are able to deal with large networks where authentication
    of multiple nodes is required. Creating a DL model that classifies multiple nodes
    simultaneously is possible. On the other hand, the greatest challenge of DL-based
    anti-spoofing methods is to obtain information on the spoofer. DL-based methods
    require training data to generate a model that can distinguish between a spoofer
    and a legitimate user. However, including any information from the spoofer to
    the training data is not practical. Unfortunately, current studies include the
    spoofer’s channel in the training process to train their models. This assumption
    is a critical drawback on implementing DL-based methods in real scenarios.

    states are calculated based on the received SNIR values (features extracted to
    avoid jammed frequencies) and the primary user occupation information. The proposed

    Instead of focusing on avoiding the jammed frequencies (which primarily considers

    mathematical models and solve a classification problem to identify jammer types.
    Applying [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) in this process can significantly overcome the

    channel capacity in the loss function. Contrary to the spoofing or jamming scenarios,
    DL-based anti-eavesdropping methods do not face a classification problem. Essentially,
    the DL models are expected to optimize their variables for the secrecy rate metric
    which includes the eavesdropper’s channel capacity. However, known DL models and
    loss functions are not fully applicable for this task. As a result, unique DL
    models are still needed to improve the performance of DL-based methods. Similar
    to anti-jamming literature, we should remark that anti-eavesdropping studies lack
    proof of concepts and testbed implementations with real-world datasets. Moreover,
    [DL](#glo.acronym.dl)-assistance is applied to a limited number of communication
    scenarios, i.e., [RIS](#glo.acronym.ris) or [OFDM](#glo.acronym.ofdm) scenarios
    are missing. The following section dwells on the future aspects of our four leading
    research directions and presents our comments.

    communications. The deployment process of the 5G technology has come a long way
    all over the world these days and the active research on the 6G technology has
    also gained tremendous momentum. It is an undeniable fact that 6G technology will
    usher in radical paradigm shifts, new thrilling applications, and groundbreaking
    technologies. AI will undoubtedly play a huge role in this irresistible revolution
    emerging with 6G. Specifically, DL approaches have been building a concrete ground
    and will most likely continue to overtake other AI branches for the bright future
    of wireless communication technologies. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive
    overview of the existing DL-based PHY techniques and shed light on the huge potential
    of emerging DL approaches under four main research directions toward 6G, namely
    massive MIMO systems, MC waveform designs, RIS-aided communications, and PHY security.
    We have analyzed the progress made so far in detail and determined major future
    research directions in each of these fields, as demonstrated in Fig. [30](#S6.F30
    "Figure 30 ‣ 6.3 Anti-Eavesdropping Solutions ‣ 6 PHY Security Meets DL ‣ Deep
    Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY
    Architectures"). Please note that it is possible to add other [PHY](#glo.acronym.phy)
    research directions to the framework that we have covered in this article. In
    fact, the usage of DL grows gradually on other [PHY](#glo.acronym.phy) technologies.
    For instance, the literature also includes [DL](#glo.acronym.dl)-powered studies
    on [mmWave](#glo.acronym.mmwave) or terahertz communications. It has been shown
    that [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) can be employed to efficiently solve various challenges
    of high-frequency communications. Moreover, [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) is also applied
    for the challenges of drone or unmanned aerial vehicle communication networks.
    However, the [DL](#glo.acronym.dl) literature on these technologies is still developing,
    and including them in our [6G](#glo.acronym.6g) framework is a future direction.'

- en: We have investigated the major developments of DL applications for MIMO systems
    from various aspects and identified the missing points that should attract more
    attention. The first issue from an intelligent receiver perspective is that most
    detectors available in the literature require perfect CSI to operate successfully.
    Since it is challenging to estimate channels in practice and even harder in massive
    MIMO systems due to their plenty of transmit antennas, developing a system model
    with a perfect CSI assumption remains a pipe dream. Therefore, receiver frameworks
    based on DL techniques composing channel estimators and symbol detectors should
    become more common in the future to support practicability. Secondly, evaluating
    the proposed models in a computer simulation environment using generic channel
    model assumptions may be deceptive since there are many more impairments in real-life
    scenarios, and we do not know how they impact the performance of DL models. Thus,
    we suggest creating benchmark channel datasets that include real-life impairments
    and encapsulate diverse settings for various wireless communication standards,
    such as 5G and Wi-Fi 7\. These benchmark datasets will allow for fair comparisons
    of DL models. Apart from these, the third vital topic for rapid progress in this
    field is the development of benchmark system models that researchers can compare
    their DL models. The number of novel DL frameworks has been increasing in tandem
    with the advancement of the literature. Hence, new DL-based frameworks should
    be compared to existing novel data-driven methods to prevent the conglomeration
    of similar models.

    advice is to concentrate solely on MU system models that require MU interference
    cancellation since almost all communication systems have been serving MU cases
    for a while. Thus, DL-based precoders should not only eliminate the effect of
    the channel on each user but also prevent a user’s signals from interfering with
    others. The second point is practicability, as in the case of DL-based receiver
    designs. We believe that experiments using SDR testbeds in various environments
    will help us examine the feasibility of DL-based models in dynamically changing
    scenarios. It is also possible to understand the hardware requirements for efficient
    DL operations. The last research direction is the actual enabler of the PHY revolution.
    Considering DL approaches’ ability to optimize a communication system as a whole
    in an E2E fashion, we question if the next-generation wireless communication technologies
    can arise without the restrictive standardization process that requires continuous
    regulations. The ultimate objective is to delegate defining parameters, signaling,
    and other issues that must be resolved throughout the standardization process
    to DL networks, therefore shortening the time between generations.

    most popular one among them. As noted earlier, OFDM has been used in modern wireless
    communication systems including 4G and 5G. Although designed on top of OFDM, other
    MC waveforms such as FBMC and GFDM could not seize the throne. Despite OFDM being
    the most powerful one due to its simplicity and flexibility, other OFDM-based
    waveforms can also be seen as candidates for 6G wireless networks. Nonetheless,
    these waveforms are still needed to be improved to meet the high demands of 6G.
    At this point, DL comes into the picture as a great tool in order to enhance performance
    and reduce the complexity of MC waveforms.

    MC waveforms. With a comprehensive assessment, we conclude that the existing DL-based
    methods have great potential to improve the performance of the aforementioned
    waveforms for 6G and may outperform traditional algorithms. However, there are
    still unaddressed issues related to the application of DL-based solutions for
    MC waveforms. Firstly, most studies focus on optimizing only one performance metric
    such as BER and PAPR. However, in MC systems, there are multiple key performance
    indicators, which should be considered while designing the system. Therefore,
    we believe that it is important to design DL-based techniques that optimize multiple
    performance metrics jointly to improve the overall performance. Secondly, while
    designing a target DL method, specific requirements of different 6G applications,
    such as eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, and their possible combinations, need to be considered.
    Thirdly, most studies in the literature focus on enhancing the performance of
    classical OFDM. Designing DL-based techniques for other MC waveforms is still
    an open topic. Fourthly, the combination of AE-based NNs with IM to increase the
    data rate or improve error performance would be an interesting design problem.
    Lastly, we observe that most of the proposed DL-based solutions have not considered
    real-world data sets. In order to reveal the true potential of DL-based techniques,
    they need to be implemented in practical scenarios by employing wireless communication
    testbeds.

    it is vital to reduce the overall system complexity by preserving the passive
    structure of RISs and achieving high performance at a low cost. Thus, it may be
    crucial to consider the advantages of optimal RIS positioning. In light of the
    aforementioned approaches, the question of how effective RIS configuration should
    be in DL assistance in order to get the best performance will arise. In line with
    these approaches, applicable RIS positioning scenarios can be evaluated for effective
    signaling and channel estimation at the user side, reducing signaling overhead
    and optimizing the transmit power.

    four major RIS deployment scenarios. As shown in Fig. [31](#S7.F31 "Figure 31

    Future Directions ‣ Deep Learning-Aided 6G Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive

    the BS side or the receiver side, or it can be positioned in a hybrid scheme as
    in Fig. [31](#S7.F31 "Figure 31 ‣ 7.2 Future Directions on Multi-Carrier Waveform

    Networks: A Comprehensive Survey of Revolutionary PHY Architectures")(d) to combine
    its advantages in certain aspects. It appears as the most advantageous option
    in terms of signaling overhead due to the close distance between the RIS and the
    BS so that the channel in between is almost static. This also eliminates the coordination
    burden when compared to distributed RIS deployments on the user side. The BS-side
    positioning has the ability to adapt to instant changes in user channels and different
    QoS requirements. On the flip side, compared to the BS-side deployment, it provides
    a more advantageous solution in providing a direct LOS in user-side RIS positioning.
    This is shown as the only aspect where user-side deployment is superior to the
    BS-side in [[302](#bib.bib302)]. However, this situation can be treated as an
    issue that can be improved with the DL approach. Then, BS-side deployment scenarios
    might gleam as bright solutions for optimizing DL-assisted RIS applications. Similarly,
    appropriate positioning by using intelligent surfaces as virtual access points
    in which BS-side positioning, might match the power of an active access point
    by using fully passive elements. These virtual access points increase environmental
    scattering and provide spatial multiplexing gain to the MIMO system as in [[303](#bib.bib303)].
    However, the assumption of the presence of initial CSI can be considered as a
    drawback in these systems. At this point, the development of a DL-based approach
    eliminating the need for initial CSI will provide significant gains in performance.'

    be investigated to see if it yields more appealing results than BS-side positioning
    due to the optimization burden caused by increasing system parameters. At this
    juncture, a novel DNN architecture can be used in the learning process of a high
    number of parameters for the estimation of the complex channel information brought
    by the hybrid positioning scenario. These scenarios can be combined with a DL
    approach similar to [[247](#bib.bib247)] and phase optimization on the RIS-side
    can be placed with a model-independent and trained DNN. In order to observe the
    variation of system performance according to changing environmental conditions
    and to determine the optimum working policy, it is vital to create dynamic user
    scenarios for the BS-side RIS deployment. Thereby, a long-term policy with the
    ability to learn for dynamic scenarios can be constituted. By an approach similar
    to [[243](#bib.bib243)], in a scenario, as given in Fig. [32](#S7.F32 "Figure

    configuration with various position information can be considered. Thus the signal
    level at different user positions can be increased effectively with DL.'

    NOMA-MIMO systems and increasing the overall system performance in terms of user
    sum-rate. In this way, lower system complexity and power consumption can be addressed,
    which will enable beyond 5G wireless communication technologies. Positioning scenarios
    while preserving the passive nature of RISs can also be considered here first.
    In DL-based studies on RIS-aided downlink-NOMA schemes, a common predicament arises
    with the assumption of having an initial CSI. However, obtaining CSI in a NOMA
    system scheme is another challenge due to the complexity of the underlying communication
    model. These schemes might be integrated with [RNN](#glo.acronym.rnn)-like DL
    approaches that estimate channel state using channel statistics, aiming to reduce
    latency in scenarios without initial CSI. Furthermore, the assumption of imperfect
    SIC at the decoding stage makes preventing MUI difficult with the increasing number
    of users. This is one of the most critical factors degrading the total user performance
    due to the inefficiency of current SIC techniques and restricting user capacity.
    Inspired by [[304](#bib.bib304)], the combination of a novel DL approach seeking
    the perfect SIC with DL-assisted RIS phase optimization can address the aforementioned
    challenges in scenarios using the downlink-NOMA scheme. Novel DL algorithms suitable
    for these scenarios can be tested with DNN or CNN architectures and appropriate
    loss functions can be developed.

    and reflecting RISs (STAR-RIS) can be considered as a field that has a gleaming
    future. By simultaneously transmitting and reflecting the incident signals, STAR-RISs
    may serve both sides of users placed at their front and back, in contrast to RISs,
    which are often distinguished by their reflecting-only property.The concept of
    STAR-RISs has been extensively elaborated by researchers in utilizing the unique
    communication framework to produce smart radio settings, which has been motivated
    by its appealing advantages [[305](#bib.bib305)], [[306](#bib.bib306)], [[307](#bib.bib307)].
    Nevertheless, the fractional shape of the objective function and non-convex restrictions
    make it difficult to solve the energy efficiency maximization problem by locating
    the global optimal solution. DL can be considered as a potential solution to overcome
    the difficulties posed by current optimization methods.

    The existing studies in the literature prove the positive impact of DL on PHY
    security. Although various network or attack models have been considered in the
    past, there are still scenarios where the impact of DL has not been tested. For
    example, the secrecy capacity of OFDM-IM/OFDM systems or RIS-assisted networks
    is widely considered in the literature. However, exploration of the impact of
    DL on these scenarios is still an open area. Moreover, the existing literature
    is very immature such that mostly raw ideas are considered. Their extensions to
    different DL networks and various system models (e.g., power/complexity constraints,
